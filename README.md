## Installation

Install necessary dependencies via `requirements.txt`, which will include the latest unreleased install of `allennlp` (from the `master` branch).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the spacy english model with:

```
python -m spacy download en
```

Verify your installation by running: 

```
SEED=42 pytest -v --color=yes vampire
```

All tests should pass.


## Install from Docker

Alternatively, you can install the repository with Docker.

First, build the container: 

```
docker build -f Dockerfile --tag vampire/vampire:latest .
```

Then, run the container:

```
docker run -it vampire/vampire:latest
```

This will open a shell in a docker container that has all the dependencies installed.

## Download Data

Download your dataset of interest, and make sure it is made up of json files, where each line of each file corresponds to a separate instance. Each line must contain a `text` field, and optionally a `label` field. 

In this tutorial we use the AG News dataset hosted on AllenNLP. Download it using the following script:

```
sh scripts/download_ag.sh
```

This will make an `examples/ag` directory with train, dev, test files from the AG News corpus.

## Preprocess Data

Run multi-core pretokenizer on downloaded data: 

```
python -m scripts.pretokenizer --input-file examples/ag/train.jsonl --tokenizer spacy --json --lower --num-workers 20 --worker-tqdms 20 --output-file examples/ag/train.tok.jsonl
python -m scripts.pretokenizer --input-file examples/ag/dev.jsonl --tokenizer spacy --json --lower --num-workers 20 --worker-tqdms 20 --output-file examples/ag/dev.tok.jsonl
python -m scripts.pretokenizer --input-file examples/ag/test.jsonl --tokenizer spacy --json --lower --num-workers 20 --worker-tqdms 20 --output-file examples/ag/test.tok.jsonl
```

```
python -m scripts.preprocess_data \
            --train-path examples/ag/train.jsonl \
            --dev-path examples/ag/dev.jsonl \
            --tokenize \
            --tokenizer-type spacy \
            --vocab-size 30000 \
            --serialization-dir examples/ag
```

This script will tokenize your data, and save the resulting output into the specified `serialization-dir`.

In `examples/ag` (after running the `preprocess_data` module or unpacking `ag.tar`), you should see:

* `train.npz` - pre-computed bag of word representations of the training data
* `dev.npz` - pre-computed bag of word representations of the dev data
* `vampire.bgfreq` - background word frequencies
* `vocabulary/` - AllenNLP vocabulary directory

This script also creates a reference corpus to calcuate NPMI (normalized pointwise mutual information), a measure of topical coherence that we use for early stopping. By default, we use the validation data as our reference corpus. You can supply a `--reference-corpus-path` to the preprocessing script to use your own reference corpus.

In `examples/ag/reference`, you should see:

* `ref.npz` - pre-computed bag of word representations of the reference corpus (the dev data)
* `ref.vocab.json` - the reference corpus vocabulary


Alternatively, you can download a tar file containing a pre-processed AG news data (with vocab size set to 30K):

```
curl -Lo examples/ag/ag.tar https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/allennlp/datasets/ag-news/vampire_preprocessed_example.tar
tar -xvf examples/ag/ag.tar -C examples/
``` 


## Train VAMPIRE

There are a couple ways to train VAMPIRE, each with their own documentation:

1) Train with CLI. This involves training with hyperparameters specified in `environments/environments.py`. This is the most straightforward if you're intending to work within the AllenNLP framework. Check documentation [here](VAMPIRE_CLI.md).

2) Train with VAMPIRE API. This can be useful if you want to train VAMPIRE _outside_ the AllenNLP framework, or if you want to integrate VAMPIRE with other models. Check documentation [here](VAMPIRE_API.md).

## Inspect topics learned

During training, we output the learned topics after each epoch in the serialization directory, under `model_logs/vampire`.

After your model is finished training, check out the `best_epoch` field in `model_logs/vampire/metrics.json`, which corresponds to the training epoch at which NPMI is highest.

Then open up the corresponding epoch's file in `model_logs/vampire/topics/`.

## Use VAMPIRE with a downstream classifier

Using VAMPIRE with a downstream classifier is essentially the same as using regular ELMo. See [this documentation](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/docs/tutorials/how_to/elmo.md#using-elmo-with-existing-allennlp-models) for details on how to do that.

This library has some convenience functions for including VAMPIRE with a downstream classifier. 

First, set some environment variables:
* `VAMPIRE_DIR`: path to newly trained VAMPIRE
* `VAMPIRE_DIM`: dimensionality of the newly trained VAMPIRE (the token embedder needs it explicitly)
* `THROTTLE`: the sample size of the data we want to train on.
* `EVALUATE_ON_TEST`: whether or not you would like to evaluate on test


```
export VAMPIRE_DIR="$(pwd)/model_logs/vampire"
export VAMPIRE_DIM=81
export THROTTLE=200
export EVALUATE_ON_TEST=0
```

Then, you can run the classifier:

```
python -m scripts.train \
            --config training_config/classifier.jsonnet \
            --serialization-dir model_logs/clf \
            --environment CLASSIFIER \
            --device -1
```


As with VAMPIRE, this model can be run on a CPU (`--device -1`). To run on a GPU instead, run with `--device 0` (or any other available CUDA device number)

This command will output training logs at `model_logs/clf`.

The dataset sample (specified by `THROTTLE`) is governed by the global seed supplied to the trainer; the same seed will result in the same subsampling of training data. You can set an explicit seed by passing the additional flag `--seed` to the `train` module.

With 200 examples, we report a test accuracy of `83.9 +- 0.9` over 5 random seeds on the AG dataset. Note that your results may vary beyond these bounds under the low-resource setting.
