Source: The time-course and magnitude of both placebo and varenicline craving response were characterized by a large degree of unexplained variability .
Neighbor_0: A pilot study is underway to investigate whether inhaled extra-fine beclomethasone may overcome corticosteroid insensitivity in smokers with asthma that may result from impaired peripheral deposition of normal particle size inhaled corticosteroids [80], due to more severe small airway disease in smokers (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01620099).
Neighbor_1: In all subjects who inhaled the small particle on one occasion and the large particle on the other, the pattern of results pointed to a larger fraction of deposition in the central airways for the larger particles.
Neighbor_2: Further, these four movements reflected the largest respective effect sizes (Table 3).  
Neighbor_3: Leukotriene receptor antagonists may have preferential beneficial effect on PEF in smokers with mild asthma compared to nonsmokers with mild asthma [39] The preliminary findings of a randomised, parallel-group 6-month study to evaluate the efficacy of oral montelukast, fluticasone propionate and placebo in 1019 patients with chronic asthma who smoke cigarettes reported that both interventions produced small improvements in the percentage of asthma-control days (primary outcome) compared to placebo (www.clinicaltrials.gov;
Neighbor_4: This would suggest that even in clinically mild allergic asthma, the airways may be under some degree of histaminic tone, and this would certainly be consistent with the previous observation that histamine H I-receptor blockade results in significant bronchodilatation in such subjects (Rafferty & Holgate 1987).

Neighbor_2: The survey was sent out to all MAPMG primary care and specialty care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants whose patients might use CAM (eg, obstetrics/gynecology, orthopedics, or neurology).
Neighbor_3: Some patients report feeling their primary care provider has become less supportive or even antagonistic after the patient has begun pursuing a Workers' Compensation claim.
Neighbor_4: Furthermore, insofar as CAM practices mislead patients with or without the presumed consent of a conventional health care provider or institution, they undermine patient autonomy.

Neighbor_0: Our results suggest an urgent need for the design of interventions to improve women's levels of knowledge and to promote appropriate behavior in relation to the major risk factors in pregnancy.
Neighbor_1: Since the effect of the intervention is not realized in the follow-up period, we will construct a Markov model of lifetime costs and benefits using the substantial literature on the long-term effect of risk factors on survival and healthcare costs.
Neighbor_2: While theoretical considerations have important implications for how intervention studies are designed and conducted there is also a need to improve the reporting standards of implementation studies to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting intervention uptake and effectiveness.
Neighbor_3: One potential reason for this is that a number of studies, within psychotherapy, have found that the most important predictor for the effectiveness of the intervention is the quality of the relationship between the therapist and the client (Cozolino & Santos, 2014).
Neighbor_4: There are significant clinical and economic consequences associated with CIN and additional research is required to better understand the cost impacts and to identify targeted interventions to reduce the burden of CIN.

Source: This finding suggests that the switch to a rilpivirine-based regimen should not be recommended .
Neighbor_0: (2) The combination of rifampin and pyrazinamide as therapy for LTBI was considered as early as the 1980s.
Neighbor_1: 65 Grosset and colleagues reasoned that since the therapy of active TB had been shortened from 18 to 6 months through the addition to INH of rifampin and pyrazinamide, the addition of either or both drugs might shorten the necessary duration of INH preventive therapy to something well below the 6 months shown to be effective in the IUAT prophylaxis trial.
Neighbor_2: Therefore, it is concluded that probably more studies are necessary to determine whether palonosetron should be recommended as the only 5-HT3RA of choice in prevention of cisplatin-induced acute nausea and vomiting.
Neighbor_3: The recommended strategy for the switch to aripiprazole in stable patients is shown in Figure 1.
Neighbor_4: More recently, Grosset's group reported on murine studies which suggest that isoniazid (INH) and rifapentine may be effective as TLTBI using very short periods of daily therapy, and bedaquiline may be effective in the treatment of LTBI due to multidrug resistant (MDR) strains.

Neighbor_1: The most frequent psychiatric diagnosis was affective disorders and neurotic stress related and somatoform disorders followed by psychotic disorders.
Neighbor_2: Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms correlated with factors such as anxiety and condition of the child.
Neighbor_3: Epidemiological studies have shown that migraine is comorbid with a number of psychiatric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, bipolar disorder and personality disorders (10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18).
Neighbor_4: 9 For example, serotonergic dysfunction, HPA hyperactivity and inflammation could predispose both to migraine and psychiatric comorbidities such as depression.

Neighbor_0: Exercise training diary was also used to report the intensity, frequency and duration of exercises practiced daily to increase female's motivation for the PFMT program and to detect their compliance and adherence.
Neighbor_1: In spite of the low exercise intensity of the training program and no changes in peak V O 2 of the arm exercise test, the lower resting and submaximal HR suggest that a period of robotassisted gait training may have induced some improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness.
Neighbor_2: The aim of this study was to determine if twice-weekly exercise for 1 h during HD could improve exercise capacity in children receiving HD.

Source: This study examined whether telephone counselling for parents and subsequent parental smoking cessation affect smoking-related cognitions and smoking initiation among children of smoking parents .
Neighbor_0: The definition of tobacco relapse was smoking cessation during pregnancy and smoking at the time of the survey.
Neighbor_1: Based on the women who participated in our study, and as in the case of starting cigarette smoking (Tjora, Hetland, Aaro, & Overland, 2011;Kegler, Cleaver, & Yazzie-alencia, 2000), it has been observed that parents, siblings and peers who are hookah users can stimulate the desire of their children to smoke hookah and children often experience their first smoking in family gatherings in the presence of their parents.
Neighbor_2: Information on smoking habits included smoking status (never, ex-, or current smoker), number of cigarettes smoked per day before the onset of symptoms, years of cigarette smoking, the age at starting to smoke, and, for the exsmokers, years since quitting smoking.
Neighbor_3: It is also possible that the association itself between mental health and smoking may have differed between the groups of women who were able to quit smoking and those who continued to smoke during pregnancy.
Neighbor_4: Conclusions-Substantial benefits to children would arise if parents stopped smoking after birth, even if the mother smoked during pregnancy.

Source: This study sought to examine the utility of hair testing as a research measure of drug use among individuals with moderate-risk drug use based on the internationally validated Alcohol , Smoking , and Substance Involvement Screening Test ( ASSIST ) .
Neighbor_0: While replication in other samples is necessary, these findings could potentially be used to guide treatment of other substance use disorders, given the strong overlap between chronic pain and use of other substances such as alcohol and illicit opiates [34,35].
Neighbor_1: Such methods could be applied to identify groups with differing trajectories of suicidal and substance use behaviors, and have been suggested by the Institute of Medicine as an alternative method for analyzing suicidal behaviors (Goldsmith et al. 2002).
Neighbor_2: The measures of drug use and HIV-related risk behaviors were modified from the NIDA Risk Behavior Assessment (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 1993).
Neighbor_3: In this study we use RNA-Sequencing to test this hypothesis.
Neighbor_4: This was done because neither self-report nor toxicology testing is likely to identify all instances of prenatal illicit drug use (Christmas et al., 1992).

Source: Wood smoke exposure does not impair vascular vasomotor or fibrinolytic function , or increase thrombus formation in fire fighters .
Neighbor_0: As the pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) increases by 10% under dopamine, while it markedly decreases (32%) under dobutamine it is suggested that changes in wedge pressure play a role in the magnitude of capillaries recruitment phenomenon related to the increased pulmonary blood flow in increasing CO.
Neighbor_1: The most efficient treatment of the low PaO2 in permeability oedema is not a drug, but consists of in- does not augment pulmonary oedema nor (~S/QT, likely due to a "protective" effect of PEEP (Fig. 7).
Neighbor_2: However, maximal pulmonary artery pressure increases after exposure were mild and no significant pulmonary vascular resistance change occurred.
Neighbor_3: In relation with this, it has been suggested that childhood obesity may lead to hemodynamic changes, with an increased systemic blood flow that responds to changes in the ventricular function, as an adaptative mechanism that could contribute to explaining the increase in the arterial working diameters [3,26,27].
Neighbor_4: Increases in pulmonary vascular tone may have particularly unfavorable consequences in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

Source: Endogenous pain modulation ( EPM ) is central to the processing of sensory information .
Neighbor_0: As a consequence of an increase in the excitability of neurons in the central nervous system (central sensitisation), inflammatory pain like the neuropathic pain is also associated with exaggerated response to normal sensory inputs (allodynia).
Neighbor_1: For instance, a direct action of clonidine on α 2 -adrenoceptors expressed on primary sensory neurons in the enteric nervous system (Stebbing et al., 2001;Nasser et al., 2006) modulating sensory afferent information cannot be excluded.
Neighbor_2: In the exercise-enhanced pain model, there were no changes in escape-avoidance, learned avoidance of noxious or physical activity In conclusion, we developed several testing protocols that assess supraspinal processing of pain behaviors in models of muscle pain and that are most sensitive in animals with unilateral hyperalgesia.
Neighbor_3: Third, electrophysiological studies on the meningeal sensory innervation have demonstrated the ability of meningeal sensory neurons to encode and transmit noxious mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli to nociceptive afferents innervating other tissues, further suggesting the possible importance of meningeal sensory innervations in migraine [19,21,[84][85][86].
Neighbor_4: Postsynaptic mechanisms also account for certain states of hyperalgesia or persistent pain after withdrawal of a noxious stimulus.

Neighbor_1: Health education, psychosocial development and better access to mental health services may also be helpful.
Neighbor_2: It is assumed that Internet-based interventions may improve mental health literacy and contribute to a de-stigmatization of mental illness, thus promoting help-seeking attitudes, intentions, and ultimately behaviors [19].
Neighbor_3: Researchers often use the concept of "proximity" to mental health care facilities when analyzing discrepant attitudes towards mental health care (Segal et al. 1980;Smith and Hanham 1991;Taylor et al. 1984).

Source: Gestational weight gain , postpartum weight retention and breastfeeding .
Neighbor_0: • Overweight prior to pregnancy and excessive gestational weight gain during pregnancy predict weight retention after delivery.
Neighbor_1: However, Asian women are smaller and experience lower weight gains; therefore, excessive weight gain may lead to harmful events 12,13 , including macrosomia, preterm birth, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and short-and long-term postpartum weight retention 14 .

Neighbor_0: Start of dietary treatment was early (mean 21.5 (range 11-45) days after birth).
Neighbor_1: This time period was conservative in the intent to establish steady-state isotope enrichment.
Neighbor_2: A ten-day period was allowed between the 2 treatment schedules to eliminate the carry over effect of earlier treatment.
Neighbor_3: A significant weight loss (10% of the initial weight) was recorded during treatment in six cases (12%), and a minor decrease (10% of the initial weight) was found in 10 other cases (20%).
Neighbor_4: Although research continues to explore exactly how bariatric surgery exerts its weight loss effects, it is clear that surgical interventions have prevailed in producing the most effective weight loss for the morbidly obese, both in terms of significant excess weight loss and long term efficacy (Miras & Le Roux, 2010).

Source: Hierarchical linear models and multiple regression models assessed individual - and center-level changes in knowledge , policies , practices and age - and sex-specific standardized body mass index ( zBMI ) , controlling for state , parent education , and poverty level .
Neighbor_0: There was no evidence that students' ST trajectories differed by BMI status (p = 0.396) or neighbourhood SES (p = 0.368) when examined in separate conditional linear growth models (Table 2).
Neighbor_1: We then examined models that incorporated education and household income to assess the extent to which these variables attenuated associations between sociopolitical context and depressive symptoms, controlling for age, gender and marital status (model 2).
Neighbor_2: Initial structural models were specified that were consistent with the conceptual models wherein, controlling for the parents' education level and the teens' ages and genders, the spiritual beliefs and practices of parents will impact on adolescents' spirituality.
Neighbor_3: Thus, we centered height and weight at 7, 11, and 15.5 years for all individuals by using predictions from linear regression models that assumed a linear age trend over short periods.

Source: High levels of IL-8 in STEMI patients complicated with HF were associated with less improvement in left ventricular function during the first 6 weeks after PCI , suggesting a possible role of IL-8 in the reperfusion-related injury of post-ischemic myocardium .
Neighbor_0: These preliminary results indicate that LT3S reversibility by dobutamine is associated with short-term hemodynamic and neurohormonal improvement in patients with persistent severe heart failure.
Neighbor_1: Therefore, it is possible that modest improvement in cardiac function and myocardial oxygen transport with delayed cyclosporine treatment may lead to improved outcomes.
Neighbor_2: Several studies have shown that TMZ is beneficial in the treatment of ischemic heart disease [16] and symptoms of chronic heart failure [17], and improves LV and right ventricular function [18].
Neighbor_3: 10,11 This fi nding suggests that the high mortality is related to the extensive myocardial injury and myocardial pump failure rather than the deleterious effects of complete AVB.
Neighbor_4: Also, the amount of intermediate monocytes was found to correlate with worse cardiac function and predicted the possibility to reach an improvement in NYHA functional class at 3 months after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [31].

Source: However , there is also evidence that lower extremity strength training might lead to such improvements .
Neighbor_0: Such improvements would have the effect of increased muscle mass being employed during the exercise test, which could lead to a higher V O 2 that was not due to improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness.
Neighbor_1: Thus, we cannot completely ascribe the improvements to improvements in muscle strength alone.
Neighbor_2: However, the observed improvement of exercise tolerance results from increased strength and endurance of skeletal muscles of lower limbs subjected to NMES therapy.
Neighbor_3: Also decreased muscle strength and balance of elderly resulted in decreased gait ability.
Neighbor_4: Recent evidence in relation to maximal aerobic capacity has suggested that highintensity training can delay age-associated decrements in VO 2max , but that training reductions, appearing to be an inevitable aspect of aging, lead to accelerated losses so that overall loss rates in VO 2max are similar between athletic and sedentary individuals (27)(28)(29)35,36).

Neighbor_0: We estimated NHS health care costs from sources that included NHS reference costs [34] and Personal Social Services Research Unit's (PSSRU) Costs of Health and Social Care [35].
Neighbor_1: The calculation of injury-related costs only included hospital treatment costs, so it will underestimate personal (e.g. lost earnings) and societal (e.g. property damage) and other treatment costs, such as treatment provided by GPs or allied health professionals.
Neighbor_2: I n medical and health care studies, "ancillary care" refers to any burden or cost that researchers may take on to address study participants' medical needs in ways not required for the study's safety or validity.

Source: In acute hypoxia , hypoxic training conferred no advantage on maximal oxygen uptake but tended to enhance time trial performance more than normoxic training ( 52 % vs 32 % , P = 0.09 ) .
Neighbor_0: The correlations show that the participants with a steady increase of their training performance had larger gains in training performance as well as in immediate and long-term ANB performances.
Neighbor_1: In order to maintain a constant training heart rate, the workload was systematically increased during the entire training period.
Neighbor_2: In addition to the steady increase, the steady performers started on a significantly higher level ( Figure 6) and showed a larger increase in training performance from the first session to the session of maximal performance and to the performance at the last session (unpaired t-test, p < 0.05).

Neighbor_1: While theoretical considerations have important implications for how intervention studies are designed and conducted there is also a need to improve the reporting standards of implementation studies to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting intervention uptake and effectiveness.
Neighbor_2: There is, however, a lack of data relating to long-term outcome for trainee-performed THA and these data would certainly be a valuable addition to the literature.
Neighbor_3: The results of this study provide empirical evidence on whether the EQ-5D utility weights are valid and responsive and thus useful in stroke survivors.
Neighbor_4: In order to determine the methodological trial components that affect treatment effect estimates, a two-level analysis will be conducted using a meta-meta-analytic approach with a random-effects model to allow for within and between meta-analyses heterogeneity [26].

Neighbor_4: Furthermore the involved bone is cortico-diaphyseal, rather than the more rapidly healing cancellous bone that predominates in the intertrochanteric region.

Source: In contrast to previous studies , we designed a pragmatic trial ( as opposed to explanatory trials ) to mimic real practice and obtain maximal external validity for the study .
Neighbor_0: To confirm the association and to determine causation, further study using a randomized clinical trial or a prospective cohort study design is required.
Neighbor_1: • Accepting and categorizing studies based on research design (e.g., randomized controlled trials [RCTs], nonrandomized comparative studies, observational literature).
Neighbor_2: Our results encourage the design and implementation of larger direct comparative randomized clinical trials evaluating triptan efficacy in female migraineurs.
Neighbor_3: We addressed the limitations of previous studies and mixed findings regarding the clinical superiority of SS over comparison treatments by conducting a rigorous randomized trial (RCT) with strong methodology.
Neighbor_4: Not reporting a study on the basis of the strength and "direction" of the trial results has been termed "publication bias.

Source: In control group , placebo was given .

Source: Increased gastric volumes and delayed emptying are possible but unexplored mechanisms .
Neighbor_0: Gastric emptying of liquids is related to volume with increased volume showing rapid gastric emptying [29].
Neighbor_1: Subsequent to this early removal from the circulation there appears to be a steady release of azithromycin from gastric tissue into gastric mucus, and from there into the gastric juice.
Neighbor_2: (1) Ten of the19 patients showed delayed gastric emptying of solids, and acute EA significantly improved delayed gastric emptying; the halftime for gastric emptying was reduced from 150.3 ± 48.4 to 118.9 ± 29.6 min (P = 0.007).
Neighbor_3: The mechanisms whereby RGES reduces gastric accommodation in obese patients include disruption of gastric activities and gastric motility disorder and gastric expansion, enhancement and delay of satiety.
Neighbor_4: Three-fourths (75%, 6/8) of patients in the rapid gastric emptying group had markedly prolonged gastric emptying time, whereas 37.5% (3/8) of the patients in the slow gastric emptying group had prolonged gastric emptying time (P < 0.05).

Source: Increasing MPV values may reflect increased intraabdominal pressures , which may have a clinical implementation in intraabdominal hypertension .
Neighbor_0: This is a more important end point because it reflects actual structural change in the carotid artery, which is associated with the atherosclerotic process, and it is associated with cardiovascular outcomes.
Neighbor_1: This change in epidemiology likely reflects both an increase in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease due to improved diagnostic methods and improvements in the medical management of infection, hemorrhage, and preeclampsia-eclampsia, more than an increase in the incidence of venous thromboembolic disease.
Neighbor_2: Additionally, the workload is increasing due to administrative work.
Neighbor_3: Furthermore, increases in interstitial or intraabdominal pressure reduce the transmural pressure of the renal arterioles, thereby diminishing arterial distension, decreasing vascular compliance and ultimately increasing RI [35].
Neighbor_4: Resting HR increased with each increasing quartile of RHR.

Source: In cross-sectional analysis , we found a moderating effect of adherence with alliance on treatment outcome , indicating that the better the therapeutic alliance , the stronger the effect of adherence on treatment outcome .
Neighbor_0: If the treatment effect is significant, cost-effectiveness will be evaluated.
Neighbor_1: Secondly, bupropion has a lower risk of sexual side effects compared to single-action SSRIs which may lead to better antidepressant treatment adherence (Gartlehner et al., 2011) and therefore better response.
Neighbor_2: PE recurrence and the side effects of warfarin treatment (bleeding) were also recorded.
Neighbor_3: Many of the available studies examining the effect of treatment options after low-dose inhaled corticosteroids have assessed the effects of treatment on measures of lung function and symptoms [2][3][4][5][6].
Neighbor_4: To the extent that TM is similarly efficacious to PE for improving PTSD symptoms, a less intensive treatment experience could translate into better treatment adherence for some patients.

Source: Independent of randomization group , compared with no rejection , death-censored graft survival was significantly worse in 23 patients with acute rejection after randomization .
Neighbor_0: Patients who did not experience rejection were censored at the end of the follow-up.
Neighbor_1: Patient survival after cancer diagnosis is significantly poorer in kidney transplant recipients compared to the general population.
Neighbor_2: Although orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) improves survival in these recipients compared with medical therapy alone, utilization of marginal donors has been associated with worse graft survival compared with standard OHT using lower risk recipients or donor organs [5,6].
Neighbor_3: These results are consistent with observations in heart transplant patients of decreased graft survival and poor outcome in hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia.
Neighbor_4: Our data also show that the graft-loss group had a significantly higher incidence of acute rejection than did the graft-survival group.

Neighbor_4: In case-crossover studies, times to event are the same for case and control periods (because periods are defined similarly within strata) and even if a stratified Cox model can be used, it does not assess and compare a time to event.

Source: No consistent pattern of improvement in diastolic function at rest or during exercise was seen .
Neighbor_0: Our results demonstrate that CHF patients are markedly impaired in their physiological capacity to perform activities of daily living compared to controls of similar age and habitual physical activity level and that this impairment is associated with both reduced aerobic capacity and muscle weakness.
Neighbor_1: We attribute this difference to a higher commitment and satisfaction of patients with the exercise than with the relaxation programme.
Neighbor_2: These results are consistent with the concept that gradual inhibition of parasympathetic influence on the heart during exercise was more pronounced in MI compared to normal swine.
Neighbor_3: Exercise hemodynamic data supports this (4), and it appears that athletes accomplish the increased driving pressure during maximal exercise not by an exaggerated PAP, but rather by having better diastolic function and, as a consequence, a lower PAWP at peak exercise.
Neighbor_4: Results-Performance in activities of daily living was 30% lower (P<0.05) in CHF patients versus controls and was related to both reduced aerobic capacity (P<0.001) and muscle strength (P<0.01).

Source: Observationally lower testosterone is associated with an unhealthier cardiovascular ( CVD ) risk profile , but this association is open to confounding and reverse causality .
Neighbor_0: People with NAFLD are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) as it is associated with a number of CVD risk factors including insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MetS), hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and abdominal obesity [5,6].
Neighbor_1: Studies comparing drinkers and nondrinkers have demonstrated increased cardiovascular risk factors in the latter group.

Neighbor_3: For the trial of therapeutic use in the setting of cardiac surgery, 31 we used the number of patients who received transfusions within five days; this outcome favoured recombinant factor VIIa, as compared with the cut-off of 24 hours, which did not show a statistically significant difference between the study groups.
Neighbor_4: Furthermore, because the incidence of cerebral vasospasm after ICA closure is far greater in an acute than in an elective treatment situation, we hypothesize that the results of tests to preoperatively evaluate tolerance to elective carotid artery closure are invalid in situations of acute SAH.

Source: The aim of this study was to determine the way of infection , pathohistological changes of the liver , virus genotype presence and sustained virological response after pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy in prison inmates .
Neighbor_0: Response to therapy is variable, and viral and host characteristics can influence whether patients achieve a sustained virological response (SVR), defined as having undetectable serum HCV RNA at 24 weeks after cessation of treatment.
Neighbor_1: Our findings reflect a patient population that is characteristic of endemic NPC since all subjects exhibited non-keratinizing pathology; however, we are unable to correlate Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status with the GTVp response since EBV serology is not routinely obtained at our center [5].
Neighbor_2: AIDS patients with CMV retinitis require long-term, if not lifetime, antiviral therapy to prevent progression of CMV retinitis, because these drugs do not eliminate latent CMV infection, and the defect in cell-mediated immunity that permits the reactivation of latent CMV infection is progressive rather than reversible.
Neighbor_3: The frequency of SVR in relation to HCV load was investigated pooling six studies with 709 patients with a low baseline HCV load and 2,798 patients with high baseline HCV load, and in both groups dual therapy achieved an SVR less frequently than triple therapy (RR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.69-0.87, p,0.0001; RR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.49-0.6, p,0.0001, respectively).
