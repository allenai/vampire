On reflection, and notwithstanding the revolutionary Highway 61 Revisited and the iconic Blonde on Blonde, and indeed his excellent autobiography Chronicles, I suspect that it is probably the lyrically sublime Blood on the Tracks album that has pushed him over the line for the award. This divine piece of work – both American and European at the same time - with its surreal imagery and its existential themes and its painterly canvas and its bleak, fatalistic take on love, not to mention its timeless tenses and its nod to Chehkov (by his own admission) and Yeats and Keats and Blake (by everyone else’s) is truly a masterpiece in honesty and craft and storytelling – a worthy winner.

Neighbor_1: Aside from listing new releases as they arrive and giving shout-outs to stuff on Twitter as we play them and to folks in person when they ask, we don't do staff picks listings nearly enough. Today, we start correcting that. Expects posts like these on a regular basis going forward. And hey, while we're at it, what are you digging these days?Jens Lekman -"Over the past decade, few songwriters have dedicated themselves to dramatizing the rise and fall of the heart as brilliantly as Lekman. Whether he's falling in love at the post office or making out during a boring Sunday sermon, his well-detailed, gracefully arranged songs inflate everyday moments and view the most banal aspects of modern life through rosy lenses, as though somebody's constantly spiking his drinks with love potion." [ full review My Darling Clementine -"...an album of country duets that sound as if they were written in the 60s or 70s. It's a finely crafted tribute to the classic country duos such as Johnny Cash and June Carter or George Jones and Tammy Wynette, with all the songs [originally written] and several sounding like lost classics." [ full review Future -"He leans hard into all those post-Lil Wayne clichés — goofily aligned punch lines, spaced-out drug analogies, dope-boy boasts, designer name-drops — but delivers them in a strained, melismatic warble, drenched in Auto-Tune and constantly cracking.

[ full review King Tuff -"King Tuff still retains a cunning and artless character, not roaming too far from the basement, adhering to its original sound. Feel-good nostalgia meets the stoned-types and the glam-punks halfway. The album's fuzzed-out appeal could make it a summer go-to disc even for audiences who live above the basement." [ full review Frank Ocean -"While he's now primarily writing songs for himself, his time toiling in L.A. studios gave him the experience to create a piece as accomplished and varied as, which swings from Stevie Wonder-style keyboard breeziness to 1990s R&B to mystic psych rock to crunching 8-bit funk without thinking twice." [ full review Bob Mould -"Where [previous Mould] albums retained hints of slick pop, balladry, broad dynamics, and that lingering squiggle of electronics,just rocks. In Mould’s case, though, 'just rocking' has always meant more: more melody, more smarts, more craft, and more depth of emotion."

Neighbor_2: "You're just too marvelous for words," go the title lyrics to the first tune on Ella Fitzgerald's 1964 studio album, Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Johnny Mercer Song Book. But it's also a fine characterization of the First Lady of Song. This album shows the queen perfecting her craft, thirty years after her debut amateur performance at the Apollo. Arguably one of the best of her eight songbook performances, Fitzgerald indubitably executes the libretto written by one of the most brilliant American lyricists, Johnny Mercer, on this album. Take the enchanting imagery in "Midnight Sun," in which she sings: "Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice / Warmer than the Summer night / The clouds were like an alabaster palace / Rising to a snowy height," the mellifluous melody complementing her bewitching vocals. Fitzgerald's elegant interpretations and sophisticated musical sensibilities float above the exquisite arrangements by Nelson Riddle, an American popular song genius. Collaborations with luminaries Harold Arlen on "This Time the Dream's on Me" and Hoagy Carmichael on "Skylark" further contribute to the album's prominence. Though not as popular as the well known Cole Porter, Duke Ellington and George and Ira Gershwin songbooks, the album's heartfelt emotion and impeccable musical architecture solidify this as one of Fitzgerald's finest works of art. —Suraya Mohamed (NPR Music)
Neighbor_3: With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of nationalism. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that "Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the November Uprising of 1830], their appeal to us artists is even stronger ... If the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. Nicholas I of Russia] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!"[175] The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein)[176] states that Chopin "must be ranked first among the first musicians ... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation."[177]
Neighbor_4: Whilst the themes may be personal, Coheed and Cambria have lost none of their remarkable ability to craft music that is epic in scope. Retaining that sense of visionary musical ambition is key to Coheed and Cambria’s success over the years, and as soon as the deft riffing and helium-fuelled vocals of ‘Island’ surge into view we know we’re in safe hands. It’s still Coheed, then, but Coheed with a lighter touch, rocking out with a barely repressed glee and hooking the listener effortlessly with a wide-eyed chorus that may be rooted on earth but yet which still gazes towards the heavens with ethereal backing vocals and moments of slow-motion beauty incorporated into an otherwise buzzing opening track. Segueing neatly into ‘Eraser’, this may not be a conceptual album as such, but Coheed are not afraid to utilise the tropes of one, and as the track undergoes yet another complex shift in tempo and style the listener is left dizzied by the sheer breadth of musical influences that are crammed into the song. With elements of Feeder, the Smashing Pumpkins, Pink Floyd and even Michael Jackson shot through the song it’s clear that Coheed and Cambria are infinitely capable of continuing beyond the fascinating concept with which they made their name. In contrast ‘Colors’ has a lighter touch and a sublime melody that does its best to break your heart in two, the band proving as deft at crafting woozy ballads as they are progressive rock epics. Of course, Coheed can’t keep their more outré instincts under wraps for long and the syncopated beat of ‘Here to Mars’ sees the band edging into more typically awkward musical pastures even as Claudio opens up with some of his most open and straight forward lyrics to date. Next up the acoustic ghost is the sound of Coheed and Cambria as stripped bare as you’ll ever hear them, and it proves a refreshing oasis of calm at the heart of the album.

Neighbor_1: But it’s still summer out so I believe that this dish needs a winter’s-not-coming-yet lunchbox update. To get us ready for the big week ahead, I used a whole-wheat sourdough bread (miche), lots of sweet summer corn, sharp cheddar cheese and scallions. Unlike the spinach version, no sauteeing or even heating of ingredients is needed — you’ll just chop and assemble. You set it in the fridge overnight or at least for several hours and bake it when you’re ready. It can then be kept in the fridge for the rest of the week or frozen in foil-wrapped squares slide into a larger freezer bag, perfectly portioned to easily be reheated in the morning before school. The other sections of his lunchbox are usually filled with kid-approved fresh stuff: cucumbers, tomatoes, strawberries and sometimes even a couple thin slices of salami. In an ideal world, the lunchbox will return empty and there will be no pre-dinner hangry meltdowns that result from mostly skipping lunch. But in the one where I actually live, we’re also going to need some after-school snacks for big and small people alike. More of that, soon.

Cook the bacon; then crumble bacon, slice green onions, cut cream cheese into cubes, measure sour cream, and measure Parmesan.

I don’t usually soak the chickpeas for this recipe ahead of time since the cooking time is so long that you don’t need to. If you prefer to soak your beans for any reason, your total cooking time will probably be shorter.

Neighbor_4: System Of A Down are an American-Armenia rock/metal band that have been playing music for over twenty years, forming in 1994 in Glendale, California. The group have been wildly successful, being nominated for four Grammy Awards and even going on to win the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance. Having sold over forty millions albums, the band were still dizzyingly successful when they decided in 2006 to go on a lengthy hiatus. Just one year previously they had released two albums, both of which debuted at Number One in the US, earning themselves a place in musical history for having two studio albums reach Number One in the same year (a feat they achieved alongside The Beatles, 2Pac, DMX and Guns N' Roses). Following the hiatus, the members of System spun-off into various solo endeavours. Serj began working on his first solo record Elect The Dead, Daron and John formed new project Scars On Broadway and Shavo joined a hip-hop group named AcHoZeN. For four years the guys took time apart to work on their own stuff, eventually coming back together in 2010 to play a string of live shows. Since then, the band has been appearing here and there, participating in various tours and festivals. Having been on the scene for so long (and now having gone so long without writing anything new) it's no wonder fans of the band have begun to recognize a range of familiar problems...

Neighbor_1: Too much was going on to keep up, and in fact the base had been hit while we’d been gone, destroying someone’s sleeping space. Soldiers on base had identified at least one firing point and kept eyes on, and we got back just about the time I saw John Loughday and Simon Wagstaff trying to kill someone with a Javelin as the enemy occupied a firing position with what soldiers identified as a B10 rocket laucher. The first Javelin failed, and so they grabbed another and launched. With six seconds of flight time to that target, the single enemy saw the messenger coming his way. Instead of praying he made a run and I heard the explosion. The men radioed down from the tower, “Hello Two Zero this is crow’s nest. Good strike one enemy dead.”
Neighbor_2: The caller said, "It's time that you guys know we are no longer playing around with the police departments. Aurora and Denver, we are about to start striking fear shooting down all cops that we see by their selves (sic). This will go for the Sheriff's Department. You guys are evicting innocent people. Let us catch you by your self and it's shots fired."
Neighbor_3: However, if we now complicate the situation by adding a non-parametric element, it becomes more challenging. Suppose that you are a fugitive of some sort, and waiting on the other side of the river with a gun is your pursuer. She will catch and shoot you, let us suppose, only if she waits at the bridge you try to cross; otherwise, you will escape. As you reason through your choice of bridge, it occurs to you that she is over there trying to anticipate your reasoning. It will seem that, surely, choosing the safe bridge straight away would be a mistake, since that is just where she will expect you, and your chances of death rise to certainty. So perhaps you should risk the rocks, since these odds are much better. But wait … if you can reach this conclusion, your pursuer, who is just as rational and well-informed as you are, can anticipate that you will reach it, and will be waiting for you if you evade the rocks. So perhaps you must take your chances with the cobras; that is what she must least expect. But, then, no … if she expects that you will expect that she will least expect this, then she will most expect it. This dilemma, you realize with dread, is general: you must do what your pursuer least expects; but whatever you most expect her to least expect is automatically what she will most expect. You appear to be trapped in indecision. All that might console you a bit here is that, on the other side of the river, your pursuer is trapped in exactly the same quandary, unable to decide which bridge to wait at because as soon as she imagines committing to one, she will notice that if she can find a best reason to pick a bridge, you can anticipate that same reason and then avoid her.
Neighbor_4: c) get out of the area. When the shooter is shooting at someone else or just randomly shooting people, odds are, the he's going to be too busy to follow you. But all in all, A-C are pretty good default strategies for your lizard brain to implement. With all three shooting scenarios, think of whatever direction he is facing as him standing at the tip of a slice of pie. The further out it goes the bigger the slice becomes. And that includes behind the target. What he's aiming at could be close to him or halfway down the slice ... it doesn't matter. The bullets will still be traveling down that pie slice until they hit something or run out of juice. While running away will help some, you gotta get off that pie slice ASAP. That is why who's he shooting at is so important. If he's shooting at someone else, or everyone, there's a good chance he won't move to put you specifically back into the pie slice. The down side is the person who is the target, might do it for you. If you're both running to the right, that pie slice will follow you. Another consideration here is: How close are you to the shooter? Notice the three arrows in the picture. If the shooter doesn't aim correctly -- even though he is trying to shoot the target, there is a good chance of missing. In fact, two of the three arrows would miss the target in the illustration. That's why we use a pie slice to show this. A problem with someone shooting at you isn't the size of the bullet, it's the size of the target you present within the pie slice. For example, look at the illustration above. If you go side to side, at the range/distance the target is shown from the shooter means the target is filling about 1/3 of the pie slice. (You could write 'target' three times across where it is on the pie slice). If you move the word 'target' up close to the shooter (right in front of the three arrows), even with variation in aim, there's a good chance of getting hit. Because when it's that close, the word target covers most of the lateral area. On the other hand, if you move the word 'target' to the top of the illustration, it would only fill about 1/6 of the possible area the bullet could go (due to bad aim). So the further away you are from the shooter -- even on the pie slice -- the less likely you are to get shot. Incidentally, we did the math on this and discovered that at 15 feet a pistol canted just FIVE degrees will miss a human sized target. We then went out to the shooting range and confirmed this. Aim at the X and then bend your wrist just a bit so the gun barrel moves about five degrees You'll hit the paper, but you won't hit the silhouette. The greater the distance, the less the degree needs to be to entirely miss the target. The further the target is from the shooter, the bigger the possible area the bullet can go -- and the greater the chances of him missing. This is why -- even though it isn't an optimal strategy -- even running straight away from a shooter can save your life. As can hunkering down as you run. Thereby making yourself a smaller target. The smaller target profile you present, by both distance and crouching, the greater his chances are of missing. That having been said, you still want to get off the pie slice ASAP. The second set of factors determining what to do: Are you inside or outside? And then you have to ask, are you outside in a wide open area or are you in a place where there is cover and concealment? There's a difference between these two. I address them in a "Tools for Writers: Don't get your character shot" piece I did ( see below). For the record, the faster you can put a building between you and a shooter the better you'll be. If you are inside with an active shooter, get outside NOW!!! A whole lot of people who get killed in school shootings, workplace shootings and spree shootings die because they crouch down behind something and the shooter walks right up to them. They don't see him coming because the same thing that hides them from his sight, blocks him from theirs. Don't hide behind doors or in closets. Head for the exit. If you have to throw a chair through a window to make an exit, DO IT! Getting into another room will give you time to open an escape route. The other thing to do when exiting an indoor shooting situation is DON'T STOP! Keep going. Not only does this lessen the chances of you getting shot by the original shooter, but you being gone makes the decision of who the first responders are going to shoot much easier. And that includes keeping you from being accidentally shot by the responders. As a side note, many schools and organizations have some short-sighted policies in this regard. People are commonly told to exit the building and wait outside in a designated area. The reasoning for this policy is the concern that if you run, they won't know if you're safe or not. Our attitude is: That's what cell phones are for. Once you are out of there, keep going, then CALL YOUR LOVED ONES and tell them you are alright. If you don't do this, then your loved ones will be calling -- or worse -- rushing to the site to see if you are safe. People milling around a shooting scene (waiting for instructions from management, administration or teachers) not only increases the difficulties for first responders, but also leaves you in danger from the shooter. If you can escape through a window, he can shoot out of one too. So forget any policy that -- while convenient for the school/organization increases your danger. If management is concerned about your well being, then have them set up a hotline to call in case of emergencies. Add to this that employers, teachers, ministers and most other authority figures probably don't have much experience getting shot at either. So they're just as likely to be as freaked out as you are. While getting shot because you made a bad decision sucks, getting shot because someone else made a bad decision really sucks. (We'll return to this idea in the shooting back section). If you are outside, get inside. But more than that, don't just run into a building and then stop and watch what is going on (we call this Prairie Dogging). Enter a building and keep going out the other entrance. This not only gets you out of the pie slice, out of view of the shooter, but a building makes pretty good cover. If you are outside in a wide open space (where there is no cover or concealment) RUN! Put as much distance between you and the shooter as possible. Remember what we said about distance from the shooter to the target? Make the distance as great as possible. Often you will find yourself in an outdoor situation that is a blend between open space and offering cover. In these situations your best bet is to utilize cover and concealment AND buying distance. You don't just duck and cower behind a car. You put the car between you and the shooter and run using the car to cover your escape. As mentioned earlier, I'm a big fan of making yourself a smaller target by hunching over as you run (3). Ducking down and running between parked cars in a parking lot or behind a row of cars on the street But perhaps the most important thing is knowing what NOT to do. Do NOT Prairie Dog! When someone is shooting do not stand there like a prairie dog and look to see what is happening. The sound of repeating gunfire tells you everything you need to know. Not only does this make you a stationary target, but by standing, you put yourself on the same eye level as the shooter. That means HE is more likely to see YOU! In NO case do I recommend just ducking down behind either cover or concealment and trying to hide. As so many kids in Columbine, Virginia Tech and other spree shootings have discovered, the shooter can just walk up to you then shoot you. No matter how much you beg and plead. The answer is almost always: Get out! Get out! Get out! (4) And if you can't get out, make it so he can't get in (Go read Alain's book for that.) Going back to when it is personal. Another set of consideration is: Is this person just pissed at you or is he really trying to kill you? Basically this boils down to what is he willing to risk to see you dead? The reason is that the pissed off person might fire a round or two at you before turning and running off or stopping shooting. But that is usually because he's achieved his goal of changing your behavior or venting his displeasure. Often if the guy wants you dead, but not at any expense to himself, if his first attempt to get you fail, he won't chase you and he will limit the number of shots he takes. For example, he's willing to shoot you with no witnesses around. BUT while he wants you dead, he doesn't want to be seen chasing you down the street. The reason being because of the danger to him. Witnesses mean prison. Another version is that while he's willing to kill you, he doesn't want you dead bad enough that he is going to risk you retaliating or someone else doing so. His game plan is you dead, him alive and unhurt. You will see this behavior quite often in drive by shootings. Where as long as they are the only ones shooting they will fire, but when return fire occurs they skeedaddle away. This incidentally was what happened during my last firefight. When I started shooting back, he decided he didn't want to play anymore. On the other hand, if the guy is committed to killing you, then odds are he will continue to try to get you back onto that pie slice and close enough that he can pump multiple rounds into you. This is where those six results of someone really trying to kill you will manifest. So You Got Shot

Neighbor_0: But with the COI report released this week, and the APPG increasingly influencing policy in the British government, Lord Alton’s role seems increasingly important to North Koreans both outside the country and perhaps unwittingly, those still there.
Neighbor_1: And it seems the British government is listening to the work of the group, with Alton saying the APPG is increasingly capable of influencing policy in London. The last meeting with a foreign office minister was arranged by the minister, not by the group, to discuss an issue on which the APPG has been particularly vocal on – the decision by BBC World to abandon the establishment of a Korea focused service last month.
Neighbor_2: Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács told Breitbart London of the importance of transparency for NGOs especially when they are foreign funded and make “irresponsible” attempts at influencing policy makers through activism rather than democracy. He said the problem was not limited to Hungary, but was a worldwide issue.
Neighbor_3: Concerns about President Trump’s leadership appear to have taken a greater toll on foreign policy experts’ views of the future than on the publics’. A majority of the foreign policy experts surveyed say that relations between the U.S. and Europe will get worse over the next 12 months when it comes to the areas of diplomacy (78% worse), economics (63%) and security (63%).

Neighbor_3: This column has consistently argued that the United States should seek to leverage Russian and Iranian shared interests in combating terrorist groups in Syria and throughout the region, as called for in Resolution 2249 and numerous other resolutions. In September 2014, commenting on the emerging Iran-Syria-Iraq counterterrorism axis against IS, we acknowledged that while “the United States and Iran cannot formally link arms in Syria … the trend to watch is the tentative emergence of what may be a truly regional counterterrorism coalition, with potential for a transformation in regional security, if managed carefully.”
Neighbor_4: He emphasized that Belarus and Russia conduct a coordinated foreign policy in the international arena. “We noted that our countries have similar positions on such matters as resolving the Ukraine crisis and combating international terrorism in Syria,” Vladimir Putin said.

Neighbor_2: In 2000 the Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) condemned attacks and alleged killings of migrant workers from Ghana, Cameroon, Sudan, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Nigeria allegedly by young Libyans targeting black migrants particularly in the East of the country, after the government ordered a crackdown on illegal migrant workers. According to a statement made in 2000 by the ICFTU the attacks “were provoked by news portraying African migrants as being involved in drug-trafficking or dealing in alcohol.”
Neighbor_3: Sex trafficking of women and children is the second most common type of trafficking for export in Africa.[71] In Ghana, "connection men" or traffickers are witnessed regularly at border crossings and transport individuals via fake visas. Women are most commonly trafficked to Belgium, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, the Netherlands, Nigeria, and the United States.[71] Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United States are also common destination countries for trafficked Nigerian women.[71] In Uganda, the Lord's Resistance Army traffics individuals to Sudan to sell them as sex slaves.[71] The Nigerian syndicates dominate sex trades in multiple territories. The syndicates recruit women from South Africa and send them to Europe and Asia, where they are forced into prostitution, drug smuggling, or domestic violence. Law enforcement reported that sex traffickers force drug use to persuade these unwilling women.[72]
Neighbor_4: The study, “A Treacherous Journey: Child Migrants Navigating the U.S. Immigration System,” found that migrant children, 90 percent of whom come from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, often flee to avoid increasing drug cartel violence in their home communities, including escaping “severe intrafamilial abuse, abandonment, exploitation, deep deprivation, forced marriage, or female genital cutting. Others are trafficked to the United States for sexual or labor exploitation.” And once they’re in the United States and caught by immigration agents, migrant children have to defend themselves in immigration court just as adults would. Courts have no obligation to fund lawyers for the kids so they have to find representation through advocacy organizations and pro bono law programs.

Neighbor_3: Rather than directly confront the greatly increased US ground forces in provinces like Helmand, the Taliban and other resistance forces are employing typical guerrillas tactics, striking at “soft” targets well away from the main combat zone, in many cases in areas where there has been relatively little insurgent activity.
Neighbor_4: But the calm is deceiving, local villagers tell Maclean’s. The Taliban are ever-present, retreating back to their tried and tested strategy of pinpoint attacks, roadside bombs and assassinations. In many ways, locals add, the situation is now worse than ever before. From their perspective, the Canadian presence was a time of more Taliban influence in their villages, but also a time of less direct conflict. “The Canadians didn’t really challenge the Taliban,” says Mahmood, a villager from the Senjarai district, 15 km west of Kandahar city. “They would fight them but only for very short periods and only targeting those who were doing the attacking. The Americans respond by attacking everyone. They attack and bomb entire villages.”

Neighbor_1: Sphinx and The Cursed Mummy is an original 3rd person action-adventure inspired by the mythology of ancient Egypt. Travelling the world via magical portals to foil the evil plans of Set. Sphinx's Journey will require all his wits, agility, and special powers. He will also rely on his reluctant hero friend, The Mummy, to help when being inconspicuous is the only solution. By finding the stolen magical crowns of Egypt, Sphinx can stop Set and save the world.An ancient Egyptian Universal Empire once joined several worlds through Solar Disc portals. The old empire was destroyed and the civilizations in each world have suffered different fates, some of them have continued contact and others have lost it. These worlds have been separated for such a long time that many of them would not recognize each other.The legend says that two forces, one negative, one positive, are trying to recover the old empire and all of its crowns again. But we know very little about these forces or if they really exist. Other people are simply trying to understand what happened and the real nature of each world. Meanwhile each world continues with it’s own way and history.Recently, strange things have been happening… News is received from many places that problems are appearing; the normally peaceful villages are now at war, odd monsters appear in valleys where there was once placid ecology... Nobody knows why…The chain of communication between the worlds remains partially abandoned, partially destroyed and so unstable that to use it is a sure way to cause even more problems and dangers. A long time ago the Great Wall in Heliopolis was built to protect the civilians. Many people have used the portals but disappeared without trace. For this reason you never know how you will be received in any of the locations or if you will get anywhere at all.
Neighbor_2: https://youtu.be/ormeH8SuvYc http://www.compileheart.com/neptune/4goddessesonline/4go/about/ A Long long time ago--- In an empty world, four goddesess got together to create the world tree Leanverde. In the center of the bud of the small world tree, the seas and the land was born. And the goddesses bestowed a name upon that world. That name is ArisGarde. In this naturally abundant world of Arisgarde Life emerged, and the people achieved prosperity. The four goddesses decided to entrust the surface to the people of the ground and willingly retreated to Celestia to quietly watch over their people. The people, under the guidance of the goddesses, and the blessings of the majestic world tree spent their lives in peace while offering prayers. A wicked being suddenly appeared, with the peaceful Arisgarde as his target. The king who threw the demon world into chaos - Demon King Jester The demon king, together with a host of monsters, invaded Arisgarde. The forests burn, the rivers run sour, and the sky turns red... Many lives were lost from Arisgarde, which has turned into a battlefield. The goddesses fought as well, but the power of the Demon king and his Lieutenants were tremendous. Enough to force them into retreat. The people were standing on the edge of despair, but regardless, without giving up, every single one of them continued fighting. Those feelings must have reached them. The four goddesses, overcoming their limits, sealed away the Demon King and successfully defended Arisgarde. And a thousand years passed--- The people of Arisgarde enjoyed peace. But in the shadows, the evil monsters who have survived steadily worked on a certain plan. Yes, the ritual to revive the Demon King Jester... When the people of the surface noticed the increased activity of the monsters the seal was already starting to unravel. The four goddesses were in deep slumber after their previous clash and the people were certain that this was the end for them. But then, a ray of hope shone upon Arisgarde. ----"The Chosen" With the power to open the way to Celestia, and let the Goddesses descend upon the surface An adventurer who has received the blessings of the goddess. We who have served the goddesses for generations, the "Guardian spirits (Royal Geists)" beckon the Chosen. To head upon the journey that would decide the fate of Arisgarde.
Neighbor_3: In Mexico as in Britain, there are plenty of ancient ruins to inspire wonder. When we look at modern ruins we get a different feeling. We are amazed by the stupendous waste and wreckage of industrial economies. An entire railway system lies abandoned, going to waste, in the eerie world explored by Puig and Domene. Elsewhere an entire island city can be experienced as a modern ruin. In fact, ruins are everywhere in modern cities. Look again at that derelict space below the overpass, that wasteland by the industrial estate. Even building sites are ruins in reverse, film footage run backwards of a city falling down.
Neighbor_4: The world is much like our own – with various terrains like forests, caverns, deserts, villages (like Lahan and the religious sect stronghold of Nisan) and larger towns (like Bledavik, the capital of Aveh, and the massive Nortune, the Kislev capital), vast oceans with small islands in them… The average citizen that I already mentioned really gives the world so much life – people have their own problems, detest the war that’s taken the lives of many of their friends and relatives, often live in constant fear or just choose to drown their sorrows in drinking… But they still persevere, trying to not only survive but also make a decent living running a stand at the market, a restaurant or even a Gear repair shop. They have their small ambitions and desires, sometimes coinciding with the party’s goals and thus very useful.

Neighbor_1: Climbing Rainier in winter can be a valuable learning experience for those heading to the greater ranges. Deep snow, bad weather, cold temperatures, and short days all make for a much more challenging experience compared to a spring or summer attempt.Most of Mt Rainier's routes have had winter ascents, but since the road to Paradise is the only plowed road in winter, a south side route makes the most sense. Gibralter Ledges, Ingraham Direct, and Disappointment Cleaver are all good candidates for a winter attempt. These routes will allow you to stay in the Muir shelter, a much nicer alternative to a tent or snow cave.Winter officially starts December 21st and ends March 21st. Any climb made between these dates is considered an official winter ascent. During the winter the prevailing wind and storms are out of the south west. This effectively strips the snow off of south facing routes high on the mountain. This makes for poorly bridged crevasses and sastrugi snow which effectively conceal hidden crevasses. A good strategy is to aim for late winter which tends to offer better snow conditions, longer days, and a better chance of a good weather window.Locals watch the weather and avalanche forecasts and drop everything to attempt a winter ascent. Traveling climbers don't have the same luxury. A good strategy is to shoot for the weeks before and after President's day weekend in February. The PNW enjoys a high pressure system every year right around that time which can last a few days or a couple of weeks.Avalanches are, or should be, a big concern. Everyone attempting Rainier in winter should have avalanche training and the necessary tools (beacon, shovel, and probe). Watch the avalanche forecasts, don't make an attempt while it is snowing or shortly after it has snowed.White outs are a big problem, especially in winter. Know how to get back from Camp Muir to Paradise. People have died trying to get back down in a white out. The NPS publishes a map with compass bearings to prominent features. Get one and know how to use your compass and altimeter. Laying in a GPS track as a back up is a good idea, as are wands.In addition to the usual kit for Rainier, the following items should be considered indispensable.Mt Rainier is magnet for winter storms. Rainier can be getting nuked while other mountains, especially those east of the crest, are enjoying relatively descent weather. On the other hand, Mt Rainier is a big mountain and one can some times get above the cloud layer and enjoy warm, sunny conditions while everything else is socked in.If you are traveling to attempt Rainier in winter allow more time than you think you need. This will give you a better chance of getting a window of good weather. Make alternate plans should Rainier be getting hammered. There are many small ski resorts and good back country skiing (if avalanche conditions allow) if that is your bag. Reliable ice climbing can be found in and around Lillooet, BC about 6 hours north of Seattle. Great mixed alpine climbing can be found in the Stuart Range which due to its position east of the crest can have better weather. Dragontail, Colchuck, Argonaut Peaks and Mt Stuart all offer reasonable winter access and routes ranging in difficulty from easy to hard.Start your days early so you roll into camp with plenty of time to relax, rehydrate, and acclimatize. Start your summit day early. It is far preferable to begin climbing in the dark than to finish in the dark. Aim to be off of the glaciers before the high altitude sun bakes the snow into a sloppy mess, ideally before noon. Aim to leave camp by 3 am at the very latest; many parties leave at midnight. Expect to take at least an hour getting ready and plan your wake up time accordingly. Pace yourself. You will spend the better part of every day working towards your goal. Be the tortoise, the hare will burn out.Drink more than you think you need and before you feel thirsty. Staying hydrated will help with altitude acclimatization. Water bladders with hoses make this easy, but be aware that water can freeze in the tube. Take precautions to prevent this. I find that having something flavorful helps me to drink more. Pack tea, instant soup, hot Jello, electrolyte sports mixes, etc. Apply sun screen to all exposed skin frequently. Don’t forget the lips and the bottom of the nose. Keep your feet dry and don't let hot spots on turn into blisters. Keep your boots laced properlyWatch the weather and never climb up into a storm. As a general rule of thumb, storms come from the north in summer and the south in winter. Conversely, if your intended route climbs under or through rock bands, make sure the temperatures will remain cold enough to keep the rock frozen together.
Neighbor_2: Predicting the weather up here must be impossible. The report said a 30 percent chance of precipitation. But I’m watching the Canyon vanish in a veil of snow and rain, the clouds turning blood stone towers two-dimensional, bleaching them gray and black as the storm works its way closer. Stacking them like cards on the horizon before absorbing them altogether. And quicker than I’d like; it’ll be on us inside an hour. It starts as sleet. Sideways pellets pecking at the camper, coating the ground white. It hardly lets up for two hours before turning to fat, wet flakes. We’re cozy inside. The furnace fires up and keeps us comfortable. The truck says its 34 degrees outside but it feels warmer when I step out for some photos. That’s when I see it: the roof, bowed, sagged under the weight of two inches of snow and ice. The manufacturer says the thing’s good for 1,000 pounds, but it’s swaybacked, a good inch-and-a-half dip from peak to valley. At first I think that maybe I can drop one end at a time. Shake the thing some. Let all that slush slide right off. So I try. The roof is suspended by two springboards, one on each end, and when I pull the tension off the board at the nose of the camper the weight of it accordions me. It’s all I can do to shake the top. There’s not enough pitch, and all that heavy snow sits right where it was. It’s worse when I try the back end. There’s less leverage there, and no amount of cursing or sweating could get the thing back in place. Beth has to come and help push. The two of us just barely get the top back up and the springboard in place. All of this, of course, has to happen with the door open. Leave it closed and the air pressure alone is enough to keep the top from going up or down. So there we are, cursing and heaving at the roof of the camper, the door open to the pounding snow, our toddler standing behind us, looking like we’ve lost our goddamned minds. There's a solid chance she’s right.
Neighbor_3: The snow will begin Saturday morning over Cape Cod and parts of the South Shore. This is due to the cold air rushing over the comparatively warm ocean waters. This is also the reason why these areas will see the heaviest snow totals. I don't expect a wide swath of 20 inches over this area, but due to the possibility of heavy bands of snow setting up, I have added that number to the map. These situations are analogous to lake effect snow and a difference of a few miles can be the difference of 6 inches of snow. If you live south of Boston along the coast, prepare for a large amount of snow. Boston itself should be in the 5-9 inch range.

Neighbor_0: That makes its detailed forecast for the impending energy transition striking. It holds no good news for oil – it says that industry production will peak in a few years and decline rapidly thereafter.
Neighbor_1: That all makes it hard to predict how this all shakes out — or where global oil prices will bottom out. The US Energy Information Administration still expects that overall US oil production will grow another 700,000 barrels per day in 2015 — though that's slightly lower than the prediction when prices were high. We're about to see if that's right.
Neighbor_2: It seems to me that if we look closely at the situation, world oil production has likely peaked, even though prices are not behaving as most had expected. Furthermore, the peaking of world oil production seems to be a major cause of the current financial crisis. The tie of peak oil to recent demand destruction points to a possible continuing destruction in demand in the years ahead, with oil prices fluctuating, but not necessarily rising to great heights.
Neighbor_3: "In 2015, just 0.1 percent of U.S. federal offshore crude production came from the Arctic, and Department of Interior analysis shows that, at current oil prices, significant production in the Arctic will not occur," the statement added. "That's why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector.
Neighbor_4: What does this mean for the oil industry? It means China will be using less, but they’ll still be using a lot of crude oil in the next two decades. It will also be reshaping the global trends in energy consumption, the IEA said. The thing is that even though China is shifting away from heavy industry as the main driver of its economic growth and into services, its energy needs will continue to grow, by 790 million tons of oil equivalent until 2040, according to IEA.

Word operations such as prefixes, suffixes, and concatenation, while natural for document processing, do not have analogous tree operations. Second, tree automata can naturally express constraints on the sequence of labels along a hierarchical path, and also along the left-to-right siblings, but they have difficulty to capture constraints that refer to the global linear order. For example, the query that patterns p1,... pk appear in the document in that order compiles into a deterministic word automaton (and hence deterministic NWA) of linear size, but standard deterministic bottom-up tree automaton for this query must be of size exponential in k. NWAs can be viewed as a kind of tree automata such that both bottom-up tree automata and top-down tree automata are special cases. These results imply that a query can be more succinctly encoded in the nested words view with complexity benefits A nested word automaton reads the word from left to right, processing the nesting edges as and when they arrive. This matches with the SAX API for XML, and thus has a natural use in streaming algorithms.
Neighbor_4: A bison/flex based parser for the Csound language is now standard. It generates an abstract syntax tree that is accessible via the Csound API. The tree can then be compiled to a Csound performance runtime using the API. Therefore, after the tree has been compiled, it can be manipulated by user code before compiling it to a Csound performance runtime. Alternatively, the user could create the entire abstract syntax tree from another language, then compile the tree to a Csound performance runtime.

Neighbor_1: Since the dawn of money, money has had three major eras: commodity money, representative money and fiat money.Now we are seeing the birth of the fourth era: digital money like Bitcoin.The first era of money was commodity money. Commodity money is money made of a commodity. There is much ancient history documenting commodities of all sorts being used, like shells and grains. Initially, commodity money was used mostly for individual or local transactions.Commodity money took a huge step forward when it started being made of metals. The first mention of silver and gold coins were the ones being used by the Lydians around 650 B.C. They were a big improvement over other commodities: more durable, more rare and more portable.And the development of coins was a very useful innovation. It standardized weight and content, especially when made by a government, and the designs made coins easily recognizable. The result was that they were more easily exchanged. Because its value is determined by the value of the commodity used to make it, a $20 gold coin would have $20 worth of gold in it.The second era of money was representative money. Representative money, also known as commodity-exchange money, is a proxy with a guarantee that it can be exchanged for a fixed amount of a commodity, like a precious metal. The most common form is a paper bill like the silver certificates used in the United States. For example, a $10 silver certificate could be redeemed for $10 worth of silver.This form of money solved the problem of whenever the logistics of transporting silver and gold were impractical. This innovation enabled larger economic transactions, especially enabling trade between countries and therefore global economic growth.Commodity money and representative money existed side by side for most of history. They both were rooted in a commodity that had intrinsic value and therefore viewed as sound money. For example, in the United States, silver and gold were used in higher denomination coins along with silver and gold certificate bills. The user would be free to use the form of money that was the most practical for each transaction.In the period leading up to World War II, commodity and commodity-exchange money began falling out of favor. The global economy was suffering from the Great Depression and the world was headed toward war. Governments wanted more money to stimulate the economy and fund their military buildups. But they already made all the money their precious metal reserves would allow. They could only make more money if they grew their reserves.But mining new metals would take too long. And the production volumes would not be large enough to make the large amounts of money that governments wanted to make. That ended commodity money in 1933 and began the representative money.The third era of money is fiat money. Fiat money's value is determined solely by government order, also known as fiat. It has no intrinsic value itself nor is there a guarantee that it can be exchanged for a valuable commodity. Instead, the government decrees it legal tender, meaning that it is unlawful not to accept it as payment. No longer was money linked to anything of value, but instead its value was based on the confidence in the government that made it.Fiat money came into being in 1976 when the U.S. government officially changed the definition of the dollar to remove any reference to gold. It was the final nail in the coffin. Until then, the fact that the U.S. dollar could be exchanged for gold was limited to between countries and their central banks. Individuals and companies were excluded from convertibility beginning in 1933.All other countries' monies were backed by its exchangeability with the U.S. dollar through foreign exchange trading, and the U.S. dollar was backed by its exchangeability with gold between countries. Now, for the first time in history, the world's monetary system was completely decoupled from anything of tangible value.We are witnessing the birth of the fourth era of money, namely digital money like bitcoin. Digital money is money that exists solely in cyberspace. Unlike fiat currency, bitcoin is created by a decentralized network instead of a centralized government. Its value is determined by the free market and not government fiat. And like commodity money, it is rare (only 21 million bitcoins can be created), durable, easily divisible (currently up to 9 decimal places), cannot be duplicated and can easily be identified through its unique cryptography.It is interesting to note that the first bitcoin was created in 2009. Recall that was after the financial crisis and nearing the peak of the Great Recession. The Federal Reserve began a series of stimulus programs to flood the economy with newly created fiat currency in hopes of shocking the moribund economy out of recession. With each dose of stimulus having little impact, the Fed dramatically boosted money supply by $4.5 trillion. That could only be accomplished with fiat money but puts at risk the confidence in the U.S. government and therefore the value of the dollar.The last major shock to the money supply ushered in a new era of money. The era of commodity money abruptly closed in the U.S. in 1933 and started the end of representative money, which disappeared in 1973. In 1933, the newly elected FDR had no ability to make additional money to stimulate the economy out of the Great Depression. Through a combination of confiscating American's monetary gold and unilaterally increasing the price of gold, President Roosevelt increased America's money supply from $4 billion to $21 billion. The result was the collapse of the commodity and representative monetary systems.It appears that history is repeating itself. The current shock to the money supply is ushering in a new era of money.is the Chief Strategist of Fortress Gold Group and was the 38th Director of the United States Mint (2006-2011).

He didn’t steal money their money they gained value from his products. Every single person who bought a Microsoft product their life was better for it. So yes Bill Gates got several billion dollars but he probably increased the wealth of individuals and society by several trillion dollars, he touched the lives of every human being on the planet.
Neighbor_3: Printing money is merely taxation in another form. Rather than robbing citizens of their money, government robs their money of its purchasing power. Many people assume that if government provides the funds we can spend our way back to prosperity. However, it’s not money we lack but production. If the government simply prints money and doles it out, we will not be able to buy more stuff; we will simply pay higher prices. The only way to buy more is to produce more. It is production that creates purchasing power, not the printing press!

Yet Davis, representing the White House, was hell-bent on denying any evidence of Clinton wrongdoing. It was absurd. There were days when the committee would reveal a memo clearly showing that the Democrats had done something untoward. In the hallway, Davis, in pitbull fashion, would insist with a straight face that the document did not say what it said, and he would self-righteously claim the GOP was wasting taxpayers’ money to wage this vendetta against the Clintons. Reporters soon began comparing him to Jon Lovitz’s SNL character, the pathological liar. (“Yeah, that’s the ticket.”) Anything Davis told us was totally discounted and dismissed.

The following players suffered a season-ending injury: TE Dennis Pitta, OLB Terrell Suggs, RB Lorenzon Taliaferro, RB Justin Forsett, rookie WR Breshad Perriman, WR Steve Smith, S Matt Elam, TE Crockett Gilmore and QB Joe Flacco. All of those players were starters or key contributors, or lost at some point as the Ravens bumbled, losing six of their first seven games. They stayed close in a lot of those losses, but in Week 14 they were humbled 35-6 by the Seattle Seahawks after starting Jimmy Clausen because No. 2 quarterback Matt Schaub suffered a concussion the previous week.

But if there's a silver lining in UGA's disappointing 8-5 campaign, it's that a lot of injured players are coming back in 2014. The Bulldogs will have to replace record-setting quarterback Aaron Murray, but rising senior Hutson Mason performed pretty well in two starts after Murray suffered a season-ending knee injury. Georgia might bring back six starters on offense, along with top receivers Malcolm Mitchell and Justin Scott-Wesley and tailback Keith Marshall, who suffered season-ending injuries. The Bulldogs will have to replace three starting offensive linemen. UGA might have back 10 starters from its underperforming defense, which started six freshmen and sophomores in 2013. Defensive coordinator Todd Grantham will be under fire to fix UGA's problems on that side of the ball. The Bulldogs open the season against Clemson at home and don't play Alabama, LSU or Texas A&M during SEC play.

It was the enigmatic Michael who showed the most explosion and burst, but what does that mean against the worst run defense in football? After holding the Niners to 71 yards on the ground last week, the Browns crashed to earth and allowed Seattle to flatten them for an outrageous 182 yards at 5.1 yards per clip. Cleveland's defense played hard for Pettine, but what felt more Browns-esque than seeing Tramon Williams keep a Seahawks drive alive just before the half with a facemask of Wilson. Instead of trailing by seven, the Browns went to the locker room down 20-10. Game over.

The Falcons recovered all three of the fumbles in their game and saw the Packers drop two would-be Matt Ryan interceptions inside their own 10-yard line, while the Patriots had to face Le'Veon Bell for only 11 snaps before Pittsburgh's superstar back went down with a groin injury. But regardless of those factors that tipped in their favor, the Falcons and Patriots were dominant from start to finish, to the point where analyzing what they did almost seems wasteful.

Neighbor_1: The single-jointed elbow bends a respectable 120-or-so degrees. The hips can’t bend much further up than 45 degrees thanks to the front skirts, but that combined with the double-jointed knee can point the leg straight backward for dynamic posing. The ankles are on a swivel, able to rotate as much as the Exia back in the day. The hinge connecting the front foot to the ankle is a bit weak, though, and more extreme poses will have the Barbatos toppling forward. What happens on a stand?
Neighbor_2: The first type of foot strike is called Pronation. If you have ever been caught “flat-footed,” then you have been caught pronating. Pronation occurs when your arch flattens on your strike, causing your foot and ankle to roll inward. This causes stress on the ankles and can create shin splints and cause other lower leg issues. A quick way to tell if you over pronate is by checking how the soles of your shoes wear out. If they are worn out on the inside of the sole, then it is likely that you are a pronator.

The arms and legs are made up of two cylinders that bend about a center joint. Speaking of joints, feel free to visualize the sockets of the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee as circles. The hands and feet can be reduced to flattened wedge shapes.
Neighbor_4: The same first aid method for choking is used for a pregnant person as for other adults. The only difference is that you should wrap your arms at the chest, above the breast and not around the belly or lower. You must generate a force by sudden collapse of the lungs instead of abdominal thrust that is more commonly given to adults. Wrap your arms under the armpits of the pregnant person. Clasp your hands at the centre of her chest, between the two breasts but above them. Lock one leg between her two legs from behind. Make sure your knuckles are aimed upward. Generate the thrust as rapidly as you can. Extremely sudden and effective thrusts are only possible when the lungs are forced to collapse substantially. A pregnant person may have her airway cleared or she may lose consciousness. If the latter happens, then the immediate next step is cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Neighbor_1: Rallied by the approval last fall of a state law banning so-called "partial birth" abortion, Michigan abortion opponents are pushing for more in 2012 — from a "Choose Life" fundraising license plate to a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Those proposals are among a number that could gain traction in a state Legislature where nearly two-thirds of the lawmakers have been endorsed by Right to Life of Michigan. "We have a strong contingent of pro-life legislators seated right now in both chambers," said Ed Rivet, legislative director for the state's Right to Life organization. "There are more bills introduced that we have an interest in than we've ever had before." Pro-abortion rights groups say the measures are part of a national attempt to chip away at Roe v. Wade, the federal court decision that makes abortion legal. "We see a lot of these bills session after session after session," said Sarah Scranton of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan. "This time around we are seeing them move more than we have in the past, which certainly worries us." Scranton said lawmakers should focus on measures to help prevent unintended pregnancies instead. The anti-abortion proposals' success will hinge on how the Republican-led Legislature and GOP Gov. Rick Snyder balance social issues with their stated top priorities — the state budget and improving the state's jobs climate. Spokespeople for Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville and House Speaker Jase Bolger each said there's time for lawmakers to debate some social issues while staying focused on economic issues. Snyder also is geared toward economy-related measures, but governor's spokeswoman Sara Wurfel said he will evaluate abortion-related bills as they move through the legislative process. Snyder in October signed a state-level ban on a late-term abortion procedure opponents call "partial birth" abortion. Critics said the state-level ban was not needed because the procedure already is banned in federal law. But supporters of the state ban say it's necessary in case the federal law changes and to make it easier to prosecute potential cases in Michigan. Now many lawmakers say they're prepared to take up more anti-abortion proposals. "I sense a lot of interest in getting this done," said Rep. Eileen Kowall, a Republican from Oakland County's White Lake Township and sponsor of the proposal that would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks, with an exemption for when the mother's life is at risk. "This is one small measure to do the right thing towards human decency." Kowall's legislation, modeled after laws approved in a handful of other states the past two years, is based on the premise that a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks. Opponents dispute that claim and also say the proposals are a departure from Roe v. Wade, which lets states limit abortions in cases where there's a viable chance the fetus could survive outside of the womb. That's generally considered to be 22 and 24 weeks. A measure pending in the Senate would tie into federal health reforms that call on states to set up health insurance exchanges for individuals and small businesses to buy health coverage. The Michigan measure would prohibit a health plan offered through the exchange from covering elective abortions. It's not yet known if Michigan will set up such an exchange, because some lawmakers — particularly in the House — are waiting to see what happens with legal challenges opposing the federal health plan. The Senate has approved bills dealing with the handling of fetal remains that result from an abortion. The bills are pending in the House. Other bills are aimed at screening before an abortion to make sure a pregnant woman isn't being forced or coerced to have the abortion against her will. Separate bills are aimed at requiring that a woman seeking an abortion is told she has an option to view an active ultrasound image and hear the fetus' heartbeat before having the procedure. Opponents call that a particularly intrusive proposal and an example of government trying to get involved in personal decisions. "They are trying to find every possible avenue to frustrate women and to frustrate providers that are in a position of dealing with this difficult choice and this difficult time in their lives," said Rep. Jeff Irwin, a Democrat from Ann Arbor. A bill that would create a "Choose Life" license plate is awaiting a vote in the Senate after winning unanimous, bipartisan approval in the Senate Transportation Committee. The plate, similar to those approved in many other states, would raise money for abortion prevention projects. The plates have run into legal challenges in some states, notably North Carolina, where a federal judge late last year issued a preliminary injunction blocking the state from distributing them. The order came after the American Civil Liberties Union sued, saying the plates violate the First Amendment because there's no specialty plate for supporters of abortion rights.
Neighbor_2: Advocates on both sides of the debate say that the number of governors and legislatures opposing abortion rights grew after last year's elections.

Neighbor_4: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama’s 2012 budget plan would slash the deficit by $1.1 trillion over 10 years, officials said on Sunday, but Republicans were unimpressed and vowed to push for deeper cuts in spending.

They soon locate where Jiraiya hid the scroll, but as the group stops to rest, Naruto charges ahead until he is confronted by the appearance of Gamabunta, Gamahiro and Gamaken. They refuse to listen to Naruto and the group who explains their reason for being there and attacks them with an army of frogs. Naruto attempts to enter Sage Mode, but while trying to gather enough energy, Kushina interferes and tries to protect him from Gamabunta but a shot of acid burns her leg. As a result, Naruto gets distracted and is unable to enter sage mode. Minato then saves both of them quickly and is able to get the scroll, dispelling the Summoning Technique.

Neighbor_1: What’s fascinating to think about, is this list of books will be how the 1960s will be remembered by science fiction readers in the future. Even though science fiction is mostly set in the future, it’s really about the period in which it was written. Psychoanalyzing the 1960s through the lens of science fiction is going to be very weird, especially when our descendants look back on us through the eyes of Philip K. Dick.
Neighbor_2: Science doesn't know everything: Premise 1: If science (or a person) can't explain X, then Y is true. Premise 2: Science can't explain X. Conclusion: Y is true. Moving the goalposts: Science explains/discovers the X of the first premise leading to the refutation of the support for Y. New requirement: Well if science can't explain Z then Y is true. Science explains Z. New requirement: Well is science can't explain W... Inflation of Conflict results if the argument refers to an incomplete agreement on a certain X, Z, or W, as sufficient to cause people not to know anything at all.[17] Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable: Science hasn't explained how the big bang began (X), therefore Y = it will forever remain unknown.[17] One single proof — Dismissing all circumstantial evidence in favor of a single "smoking gun" that may not (and may not need to) exist. Shifting of the Burden of Proof (onus probandi): When one asserts something to be true without evidence for one's position, or against it in the case of a Negative proof (also known as proving non-existence), and then asks people to prove them wrong. (A person asserting a fact is the one who has to have proof, not the other way around.)[17][11] Missing Data Fallacy: One's hypothesis has been proven wrong. One asserts "Well there is yet to be discovered information that will prove my flawed hypothesis or conclusion to be true."[17] Appeal to Complexity: I can't understand something therefore no one else can either. This could be due to Willful ignorance.[17]
Neighbor_3: The line between fantasy and science fiction can be vanishingly thin, particularly with Doctor Who’s extremely loose definition of what the latter even is. There is an entirely reasonable and justifiable argument that Doctor Who has never been—or at least only very rarely been—science fiction, and that goes double if you happen to believe that proper science fiction should be at least somewhat concerned with scientific accuracy. By that standard, most of this season’s episodes don’t just fail but fail most hideously, with “Kill The Moon” first in line. But scientific accuracy has always seemed rather beside the point with Doctor Who’s approach to storytelling; its conception of science fiction fits far better in the Twilight Zone tradition, in which the specifics of the future and its technology matter less than what those things reveal about the human—and, on occasion, Gallifreyan—condition.
Neighbor_4: I have tried to avoid autobiography in this piece as far as possible. John Bunyan’s memoir of his personal conversion, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), contains only a few very scattered autobiographical data, despite the fact that the book comprises his own life story. Since in effect I’m writing ‘Atheism Abounding to the Chief of Christians’, I should probably do the same. But I’ll mention one thing about me: I am a writer of science fiction stories. I’m a university academic too, but I often find it easier to think in terms of story than according to the drier precepts of cognitive ratiocination. At any rate, I’m going to close with a science fiction story. And, appropriately to the burden of this essay, it will be in one of the most despised modes of the genre, the Adam and Eve fable.

Neighbor_1: But fast-forward—I think, by the '90s, right, and 2000s, right? In many ways, in the wake of the establishment of the King holiday, we see the civil rights—the history of the civil rights movement begin to get kind of reshaped and twisted into this very happy, limited story of a—this American movement that rises up and changes America, and then we vanquished racism, and there's this dreamy Martin Luther King and this quiet Rosa Parks. They’re sort of the two people we get in that narrative. And that’s a very happy story, and it makes us feel good about ourselves as a nation. And that story, I think, is part of what is at the center of the kind of national spectacle made of her passing.

Neighbor_1: The Treasury regards the change as one of the most important measures it can introduce to rebalance the economy. Osborne claims the move would provide a boost to the private sector in the north and south-west, arguing that employers in these areas cannot afford to recruit staff owing to the relatively high public sector wages in cheaper areas of the country.
Neighbor_2: The transport strikes of recent years take place within a wider political battle going on over the future direction of the EU’s and Ireland’s political economy. Simply stated, the approach to resolving the crisis of capitalism of 2008 has been to socialise the costs of the financial crisis, to reduce public expenditure on public services, and to push for new routes for capital accumulation. In Ireland, this approach underpins the confidence and supply agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil which is premised on ‘meeting in full the domestic and EU fiscal rules’. The EU’s fiscal rules curtail increasing public subventions while also encouraging competitive tendering of public services, including transport. The EU’s parties and policymakers of the right continue to advocate privatising public transport, notwithstanding much evidence, experience, and common-sense to suggest that public sector provision is as good if not better. In fact, a growing number of cities across Europe have mobilised to take back into city or public ownership formerly privatised transport networks.
Neighbor_3: In a recent paper, Mr. Danziger and Maria Cancian, professor of public affairs and social work at the University of Wisconsin, argued that because of changes in the economy, in the population and in social policy, economic growth per se did less to reduce poverty than it used to. Specific efforts to raise low-end wages, support working parents with child care and tax credits and raise education levels will be vital to reducing poverty, they said.
Neighbor_4: We should consider the possibility that the best way to provide merit goods like higher education, health and housing, while keeping costs under control and preventing price-gouging by providers, is to do it directly through public sector provision. Instead of expanding student loans, why not increase funding for low-tuition or free public colleges and universities, including community colleges?

Neighbor_1: Essentially one big, gory game of hide-and-seek (with a little bit of “scavenger hunt” thrown in to make things harder), the game pits seven camp counselor players up against another player acting as Jason, equipped with all the typical slasher villain tricks—offscreen teleportation, insane resistance to damage, the ability to magically know where his prey is at all times. When everything comes together, it’s an incredibly tense game of cat and mouse, forcing players to flee in terror from the advancing, murderous juggernaut.
Neighbor_2: I wasn’t ready to go into panic mode after the Atlanta game, and I’m not thinking the Dolphins defense is where it needs to be after their uneven performance against Tampa Bay either. My belief is that this unit still hasn’t come close to executing to the level of talent that is on the roster, but is closing the gap. The push in the pass rush was much more frequent and the linebacking unit fit the run with more discipline. Next week’s game at home against a potent offense in the Cowboys should give us a clear indication of this entire group and hopefully a better understanding of what to expect in the regular season.
Neighbor_3: Players need to think ahead and plan their moves in order to be successful in Bloodborne. This isn’t a “twitchy” game and instead it requires skill and timing to take down your foes. What’s interesting is unlike the Souls games, Bloodborne places more of an emphasis on offensive attacks and doesn’t feature any kind of parry mechanic. A new feature dubbed the “regain” system allows the player to strike back when hit, giving you a small window to regain some of your character’s lost energy.

Neighbor_3: With gay marriage now legal in America, there is also the sense among online social justice communities that trans rights are “the new civil rights frontier” (as Time magazine wrote next to a photo of the Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox). Social media has acted like an accelerant on this fire: sites like BuzzFeed and Huffington Post’s LGBT section offer uplifting tales of transgender children’s achievements and famous adults coming out, alternating with occasional three-minute hates for “TERFs” (trans exclusionary radical feminists), a group who are said to be inciting violence against trans women by refusing to accept them as women. Sharing such articles has become a badge of progressive correctness. The word “TERF” is sprayed around like confetti, with very little understanding of what it means. I’ve been called a TERF, even though I think trans women are women and absolutely have a place in feminism. I think it’s become a politer way of saying “witch”.

The image processor jumps to Expeed 5A from 4A, which brings with it some new features. Most notable, it will do 4K movies at 15 frames per second; Nikon promises it "doesn't look cartoonish." Like the V3, it can now do higher-resolution slow-motion video playback, 3 seconds of 720/120p along with the older faster-frame-rate choices at lower resolutions. There's also electronic image stabilization and the ability to use Active D-Lighting with movies as well.

And while it does have the ability to record video, the options for movie recording, such as resolution and frame rate, focus and audio recording are very limited compared to Canon's other current line of HD-DSLRs. For example, video resolution is maxed out at 1080/30p, despite the dual DIGIC 6 processors that allow for 1080/60p in cameras like the 7D Mark II. Furthermore, the 50-megapixel sensor is not a Dual Pixel AF sensor, so Movie Servo AF will not be as fast and smooth as on the 7D Mark II and 70D. There is also no headphone jack, but at least there's an external microphone input.

Neighbor_1: Optimus Nova Plus Multifuel burner Still a big fan of this. It struggled with the dirty fuel in Zimbabwe where I had to clean the jet every couple of days, usually I clean it once a month. I use the 0.6l fuel bottle, for longer stretches I use a 0.5l coke bottle for the extra fuel. Optimus Terra Panset Replaced these in Windhoek for a slightly smaller pan. I think the Optimus set is ideal for 2 people, its a bit large for one person. I also use a small frying pan as the lid. Titanium Spork Still going strong, can eat just about anything with it, spaghetti doesn’t work very well though. Sea to summit kitchen kit (herbs/spices etc) A convenient set/bag to keep all my kitchen utensils in (knife, leatherman, pan handle, lighter, spork etc). Though the original containers are too small for anything more than a weekend. Opinel pocket knife (a little old fashioned, but cheap and still my favourate) Bottle of wine (for the flavour of course) Mug: My cheap plastic mug died months ago, now I use a local good old fashion tin/enamel mug that only cost 50c. And to think I almost bought a titanium mug before the trip, that lightweight/forum/keeping up with the Jones’s brainwashing really is non -sense. MSR Dromedary watersack (2x 4L) great for storing that extra water and easy to attach to my MSR water filter. I also use one of these as a shower when wild camping. The small caps have started leaking recently though, I still need to do some Mcguiver trick on them. MSR water filter : Haven’t used it for months but gives me great piece of mind to have it. The last couple of countries have had boreholes in almost every village. Its a little bulky but easy to use, though MSR claim it only takes 1 minute to filter 1 litre this is a little ambitious (laboratory conditions? ), in reality it takes 2-3 mintues with fairly clean water. The dirtier the water the more often you need to clean the filter (with scotchbrite). Sometimes after every litre making a more realist time of about 30-40 mintues to do 4-5 litres with a poor water source. Though every water filter will have the same issue I suspect.
Neighbor_2: - Tea: If you don’t want to eat the Magic Truffles you can also extract tea out of them. Boil some water and let it cool off for some minutes. Cut the preferred amount of Magic Truffles in small pieces and put them in the water. Now put the mixture in a small pan and heat it up. Make sure the water does not cook. This will remove the psilocybin! Let it stand for about 10-15 minutes and then filter the water into a cup. You can now add a tea flavor to your Magic Truffle tea or use some honey for a better taste.
Neighbor_3: Sea salt to top Instructions Toss the dates, peanut butter, vanilla extract, hot water, and salt into a food processor and process until smooth. You may need to use a rubber spatula to occasionally scrape down the sides. Add the almond meal and process until everything is smooth. Scrape out the date mixture onto a baking sheet that is lined with either a silicone baking mat or greased parchment paper. Flatten and spread it out until it is in the shape of a square/rectangle and is about ½ inch thick. Freeze for about an hour. About 20 minutes before you remove the caramel from the freezer, temper the chocolate by bringing a small pot of water to a boil and lower it to a simmer. Place a metal bowl right over the pot but make sure it does not touch the water. Add about ¾ of your chocolate shavings into the bowl and stir with a rubber spatula. Once the chocolate has melted, remove the metal bowl from the pot and add the rest of the chocolate into the bowl. Stir until the chocolate has completely melted. Quickly remove the caramels from the freezer and cut them into small squares. Use a fork (don't insert the fork directly into the squares, scoop them) and coat the caramels in chocolate. As you place the chocolate covered caramels down on a plate lined with greased parchment paper, sprinkle a little bit of sea salt over the chocolates (don't wait until the chocolate hardens or else the salt won't adhere). Leave the chocolates at room temperature and enjoy! 3.5.3226
Neighbor_4: to taste Salt Instructions Drain water completely from the chickpeas and dry them using a kitchen towel. I like to place them in a single layer between two kitchen towels to get rid of as much water as possible and then leave them outside for half an hour or so. Pre-heat oven to 200 degrees or 400 degree Fahrenheit. Lay them on a roasting tray in a single layer and drizzle with 2 tablespoons Olive Oil and sprinkle with salt. Mix well. Let them roast in the oven for 30-40 minutes and keep stirring them every fifteen minutes or so. Reduce the oven temperature to 175 degrees at the 30 minute mark. After 35-40 minutes, remove them from the oven and sprinkle with all the other spices and remaining olive oil. Toss well and put the tray back in the oven for 3-4 minutes. Any longer will burn the spices so be careful at this stage. Let them cool completely before storing them in an airtight container. The chickpeas stay crisp and crunchy for up to a week. Notes Note 1: If using canned chickpeas, drain completely. Feel free to use your own spice blend. I love using honey and mustard oil for a honey mustard blend too. The nutritional information below is for 6 servings.

Neighbor_1: A couple of years passed by and, in 2013, Thakur retired from Tata AutoComp and became non-executive director and chairman of TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd, a subsidiary of Tata Motors Ltd.
Neighbor_2: The family-owned Tata conglomerate is a massive and well capitalised company into everything from information technology consultancy to Tetley Tea. More relevantly, it owns the Anglo-Dutch steel company Corus and its own automotive division, which recently unveiled the Tata Nano – India's car for the masses. If all goes well, Tata will invest in the Jaguar and Land Rover brands and reap rewards which eluded Ford, thereby securing British jobs. In return, Tata will learn much about the premium and executive car markets it is desperate to enter.
Neighbor_3: It began successfully, as Tata and Ambani sacked their internal teams, and hired Radia. They did it for different reasons, though. In the early 1990s, after facing down rebellious group CEOs/part owners such as Russi Mody (of Tata Steel) and Darbari Seth (of Tata Chemicals), Group Chairman Tata did not want to face similar trouble. He centralised key functions in Tata Sons, one of these being lobbying. But since Tata Sons needed a huge establishment to perform such tasks, it was simpler to outsource it to a loyalist like Radia.
Neighbor_4: Modi let it be known that he wanted Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Group at the time, to attend the 2005 edition of the Vibrant Gujarat Summit, the second edition of a biannual investment carnival founded in 2003. Modi's best officials were asked to move heaven and earth if need be to get Tata to Gandhinagar, according to a person who was coordinating some of the efforts from the chief minister’s office. "Niira Radia, who was then handling Tata group’s external relations, was categorically told that he had to be there,’’ he said. Finally, Tata agreed to attend.

One of them, Frýdek, had a mostly Czech population, the other three were mostly inhabited by Poles.[2][3] During the 19th century the number of ethnic Germans grew. After declining at the end of the 19th century,[4] at the beginning of the 20th century and later from 1920 to 1938 the Czech population grew significantly (mainly as a result of immigration and the assimilation of locals) and Poles became a minority, which they are to this day. Another significant ethnic group were the Jews, but almost the entire Jewish population was murdered during World War II by Nazi Germans.

Neighbor_1: Located between Germany and Russia, Poland has always been a focal point of conflict. In 1772, 1793 and 1795, as Poland went through what is known as the three partitions, its size progressively reduced. With the last partition, the country all but disappeared from the map for 123 years and only gained back independence in 1918. World War II left Poland destroyed and its population decimated. As if that wasn’t enough, the country then came under Soviet control. In 1981, in response to the rising Solidarity movement, the government introduced martial law, severely restricting normal life and freedom of the Polish population. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Poland joined the ranks of other Western democratic countries, but not without a long and difficult period of transformation. And yet, despite the traumatic history, Polish people remain optimistic.
Neighbor_2: Piast dukes continued to rule Silesia following the 12th-century fragmentation of Poland. The Silesian Piasts retained power in most of the region until the early 16th century, the last (George William, duke of Legnica) dying in 1675. The first German colonists arrived in the late 12th century, and large-scale German settlement started in the early 13th century during the reign of Henry I[11] (Duke of Silesia from 1201 to 1238). After the era of German colonisation, the Polish language still predominated in Upper Silesia and in parts of Lower and Middle Silesia north of the Odra river. Here the Germans who arrived during the Middle Ages became mostly Polonized; Germans dominated in large cities and Poles mostly in rural areas. The Polish-speaking territories of Lower and Middle Silesia, commonly described until the end of the 19th century as the Polish side, were mostly Germanized in the 18th and 19th centuries, except for some areas along the northeastern frontier.[12][13] The province came under the control of Kingdom of Bohemia, in the 14th century. Silesia passed to the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria in 1526, and Prussia's Frederick the Great conquered most of it in 1742. A part of Upper Silesia became part of Poland after World War I, but the bulk of Silesia formed part of the post-1945 "Recovered Territories".

Neighbor_4: France has an established Jewish population predating the French Revolution. In 1791 it was the first European country to grant its Jewish population citizenship. But at this point the majority of French Jews come from North Africa, where they had lived for centuries, arriving there with the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D. and again after expulsion from Spain in 1492. Before World War II, the Jews represented a significant population in the colonies of North Africa—about 140,000 in Algeria; 105,000 in Tunisia; and 225,000 in Morocco. In North Africa today, only a tiny fraction remains. As the French colonial period collapsed in the 1950s and 1960s, these Sephardic Jews found themselves in increasingly uneasy territory, especially in Tunisia and Algeria. In Algeria, the French had granted Jews French citizenship in 1870, giving them a distinct advantage over their Muslim counterparts and further eroding relations between the two populations. Educated in French-Jewish schools in their North African homelands and fluent in French, many Jews saw France as an obvious destination.

But this is illustrative of the general problem. Romney’s house sounds tacky and extravagant, but it’s not some kind of public safety hazard in urgent need of regulation. You shouldn’t need dedicated lobbyists to get permission to build buildings on property you legitimately own. At the end of the day, Romney is going to be able to hire the lobbyist and get his mansion built. But these same hurdles afflict people who might be interested in affordable housing for low-income people or simply regular old market rate structures for the middle class.
Neighbor_3: But for her, the momentum for the Baltimore Transgender Alliance is still going strong. Right now the alliance is fortifying its infrastructure and applying for grants, and hoping to within a couple of years start a trans-inclusive residential space in the city. She is frustrated that when the trans community demands housing—as they have for decades—they get a “new HIV study” instead. “There’s a very clear and loud undertone to a lot of things,” she said, referring to the lack of shelter and resources for trans people and the legislation that puts them more in danger. “Like bathrooms, it’s not about bathrooms, it’s are we allowed in the population or not?” Georgia McCandlish and Person Abide agreed that the momentum that Bell Foundry tenants had in their respective projects continues. Georgia still volunteers with Baltimore Jail Support, which meets people getting out of jail every Sunday evening and offers them food, clothes, and rides home. Jail Support, which used to use the Bell for meetings and storage, is still looking for a home for their supplies, as is Castle Print Shop (find them—and Qué and Elon—at Open Space’s Publications and Multiples Fair in April), whose equipment is now at the Holy Underground, another DIY space. In December, Georgia took advantage of the freedom from rent and traveled south for a bit to visit some friends and help out with a project or two here or there. “When I’ve been here I’ve been keeping two bags in my car and staying with the ample friends who have offered, and I just got a room,” they said. The room is in Horizontal Housing, a housing co-op started by people from the Baltimore Free Farm collective, who had to go through a number of legal processes to buy the Hampden property. After the eviction, Person did some renovation work on a vacant home that her friend owns in exchange for a place to stay. Dealing with that upheaval, she said, “was burdensome in a way that’s wearing, and I feel tired, but I was able to turn my concerns toward making space for other members of the [Bell Foundry] household.” Many people said the Bell community was like family. “The BROS are always singing, it’s real easy to catch a creative energy and exchange it with people,” Elon said. “There would be days I didn’t have any money for food and someone would make a big meal. They were all about that kind of thing.” The community’s response—both immediate neighbors and the art community who helped move out and clean, who offered places to stay and store people’s belongings, and who raised money to help the evictees—was heartening. The Bell Foundry was important for different reasons for different people over the years. “A lot of people who invested money into us once we got evicted were people who were artists who have traveled, and when they needed a space to stay they hit up the Bell Foundry,” Elon said. “Historically that space is like a beacon. We created a lot of cool stuff in there. I’ve had some cool-ass experiences with people there. So I can just understand, and it makes me feel good that our community can really come together for a specific cause like that. A place where you can come and just like—you could tell everyone’s having a different experience at the same time.”
Neighbor_4: It tends to instead be people willing to volunteer their time and work to make something happen. So community organizing is built around tactics that take advantage of those resources — like going door to door and talking to people, and building a large number of people to demand change. People tend to have the most impact by going to their elected officials as voters to demand a change, or going to a corporation as consumers to demand change.

Neighbor_3: I’m a sucker for camping sets and this is now my favorite campsite set. As an adult builder I don’t play with the Lego’s but I enjoy creating a nice scene using similar type sets. For instance, I combined this set with 60057 and 60117 (van & caravan). I love that the minifig is just relaxing on a chair while fishing on the lake. Very cool. This is a set that looks good 360 degrees and have some nice details. There is an axe on a stump, a small fir tree, a little frog and of course the moose. The set also has a great price point. $29.99 is a nice price point for a 368 piece set but the current Amazon price of $23.99 is really good. The set contains almost exclusively basic pieces which keeps the price down but I still like the price for what you get.

Neighbor_1: Two unmarked frosted-glass doors open onto a raw-concrete space with electrical wires and pipes hanging from the ceiling. Sheets of plywood were stacked haphazardly against the walls; plastic buckets and garbage cans were scattered across the floor. It looked like an abandoned construction site. In an unfinished room, I counted seven 20-somethings sitting at scuffed wooden desks and plastic foldout tables. Trump memorabilia festooned the walls. “This is all stuff people sent in,” said an earnest young man in a suit who works in voter outreach. He was sitting under an architectural rendering of the border wall that Trump insists Mexico will pay for. On the floor nearby was a model of the White House topped with a cardboard Trump cutout, American flags, and a pair of pink flamingos.
Neighbor_2: In the middle of dinner, Antonino Pezzino discovered that his house was on fire. It was late December 2003, and Pezzino was at his home in Canneto di Caronia, a one-street town in the north of Sicily. The source was a fuse box, engulfed by flames so intense that they swallowed the heavy curtains that hung nearby. S’è bruciato tutto qui. All burned here. Pezzino, a 43-year-old insurance salesman, put out the fire and snapped a picture of what was left—a black and gray tangle of wires against a sooty white wall. Like the others on the street, the house was a refuge against the brilliance of the Sicilian sun and the sea—tight, shadowy interiors crowded with dark textiles, heavy wooden furniture, and framed photographs. A normal home, a normal fire. But then a few days later the kitchen fan caught fire, and the television, and other appliances, immolated as if by a secret hand. Canneto di Caronia is an outpost of Caronia proper, a small town of about 3,400 people halfway between Palermo and Messina, overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is a city of bricklayers, construction workers, small-business owners, and contadini, farmers worn by years of work in the sun. Thirty nine people lived in a dozen houses along a road called Via Mare; another hundred residents lived in the surrounding hillsides. Dusty chickens cluster in green yards, and when you pass by, dogs bark and jump, rattling the chain-link fences. In the winter, heavy yellow and orange citrus dot the emerald green hillside running down to the sea, and the air smells of smoke and soap from farmers clearing their fields and from clothes drying in the sun. The homes on Via Mare stand pushed together like stucco-and-stone teeth facing the water, with terra-cotta roofs and wild gardens. A looping ramp connects them to the main road above. In the weeks that followed, Pezzino’s neighbors—his father, his mother, his aunt and cousins, who lived close together in four or five attached houses—also experienced unexplained fires. Pezzino lived with his wife, Maria, and a son, Giuseppe, who was 15 at the time. Together with his father, Pezzino had built his home in the 1980s; now he assumed faulty wiring was to blame. At the end of January, he changed the wiring, but the fires continued. Pezzino, who goes by Nino, is a large man with a heavy brow, a gray shock of hair, and a pointed chin. He has a skeptical but confident manner; he knows that the world is broken and that the trick is finding the right person to pay for the repairs. As the fires spread, the family began to suspect problems with the town’s electrical grid, which is run by ENEL, the national electrical and gas provider. Pezzino called ENEL, but the company was unresponsive. So one Sunday afternoon he called Pedro Spinnato, the mayor of Caronia. The two men were close. For a time after Spinnato was first elected, in 1996, Pezzino had served in his cabinet. When Spinnato arrived, he immediately “understood that something was weird,” he recalled. Two electricians had tested the frizzled electrical system, but they couldn’t find the source of the flames, so they decided to cut power from the central plant to the houses until they knew what the problem was. But the fires kept coming, even with the electricity off. Metal, plastic, and insulation all burned. Throughout the village, outlets burned red hot through the holes—cords lit up like sparklers, an electrical motor melted. Appliances rebelled against their owners. Mayor Spinnato called the main branch of ENEL in Palermo, the state government, and the Protezione Civile, or the civil defense, the Italian equivalent of the National Guard. “All the offices, institutions, and the people that can somehow do anything,” he said. The little town was an inferno. Smoke poured into the sky, and sirens blared from one end of the street to the other. In the first three months of 2004, residents reported 92 fires. Firemen crowded into tiny rooms in tiny homes, onto the staircases. The homes had been built by the people who lived in them, or by builders they knew, and their houses and their carefully saved-for things were burning. Their blackened furniture sat in the street like a torched yard sale. After the firemen came the press, crowding the tiny street with cameras. Pezzino became the portavoce, or spokesman, for the residents. “It is like we are living in a microwave,” he told the press. This became the town’s rallying cry. One of Pezzino’s neighbors had installed a new electrical system just six months earlier, and it too caught fire. Later, recounting these events on an American program called The Unexplained Files, the man would recall mattresses catching fire as people slept on them. “Una cosa incredibile,” he said into the camera. “An incredible thing to happen in such a tiny village. We had never seen anything like this before.” In one scene, Giuseppe slides past a doorway in the Pezzino home in a heavy down coat, his eyes so wide with fear that you can see the whites. In another home, Pezzino’s aunt’s wedding presents, her photos, her silver, the linens made by her mother—all of it burned. The train from Palermo to Messina goes through Canneto: The tracks run behind the town’s only road. That winter, residents noticed that when the train roared past, the fires would begin again, as though the railcars were setting them on their journey. “We didn’t know what to do,” Pezzino told me. “We were in the dark.” On February 9, two houses burned. One of Pezzino’s neighbors rushed to the local police station with the bottom of his pants burned and his shoes on fire. An article in a national newspaper reported that he said the devil was burning behind him and then thrust his shoes into the hands of a police officer. His daughters’ bedroom had burned, charred black. He and his wife were afraid to leave the children alone in the house. They felt “fear, anger, and desperation,” his wife would tell The Unexplained Files, with her arms crossed in front of her chest. “When you lose everything, you become desperate.” That day, Mayor Spinnato, along with the Protezione Civile, ordered the residents of Via Mare to evacuate. Spinnato is a thoughtful man of medium build, an architect by trade, well dressed, with curly hair and searching pale gray-green eyes. He lives with his wife and children in a home in Caronia Marina that is traditional on the outside and stylish and bright inside. He is an atheist and a democrat who does not believe totally in his party. He joked to reporters that the fires were punishment for the town electing a communist mayor, referring to himself. When he came into office, he was prepared for forest fires, flooding, even earthquakes. “But something like this, you wouldn’t imagine,” he told me. “Usually, you know the how and why. But we didn’t know these things, so we didn’t know how to face them.”
Neighbor_3: It may not be the biggest base on the server, But I would say it's the nicest. With a claim of about 76 x 72 blocks people would say it's quite small for what it's packing. It is a eye catcher. The exterior of our lovely humble villa is gorgeous. From all the small details all along the walls to the sprawling towers overlooking the great lands below. To our quaint tree that resides in the courtyard of our villa. But our base is just superficial beauty on the outside. The inside of our base is also a thing of true beauty. With windows that sprawl along the entire base it is far from short of views. In the attic of the west and south buildings is where we stored our villagers and held our firework launcher. Like most of the base we tried to keep it as free from clutter as we could. Only needing the essential to having a beautiful yet functional base. As we leave the our lovely villa into our sub levels you enter our art gallery. This is also where we house our state of the art 5 tone alarm system so we know when intruders enter our courtyard. Along with a modest sugar cane farm besides a villager spawner and sorter. As we head towards the next floor we have our villager holder, where we house the finest traders in the land. Now we move down to the next floor where our residents live. Each room big enough to house all the needed amenities for a minecrafter, along with a public area for brewing pots,smelting large qualities and extra storage. As we find out way down a long stairway to the main floor we turn and see our grand room. What first catches our eyes is the massive tower holding the weight of the base, which doubles as a water drop to safe rooms with a hidden piston exit. Behind the massive pillar is where we store our modest supplies, with end portal near by. On either side of the storage is where we flaunt our massive Light Brigade logo. Complete with a truly fancy floor and warm walls. As we walk pass our end portal we go down to our small auto reed farm, netherwart farm, and into our dual spider grinder room. We need to head back up and go down the other set of stairs which leads us to our massive auto harvest farm and our simulated free range pasture. We continue down to our lowest level where we house our compact 24 portal 14x14 wide gold farm encased in nether brick and obsidian. Our final destination is our large tree farm that provided all the lovely wood for the entirety of the base.

Neighbor_2: The argument rests on claims that, as the housing bubble inflated in the early 2000s, the Fed kept short-term interest rates much lower than economic conditions warranted. Since low interest rates should, all else equal, encourage borrowing, and since mortgage debt is by far the single largest category of household borrowing, the case continues that easy credit engineered by the Fed pumped up the demand for homes and inflated the bubble. The corollary to this argument is that, rather than keeping rates low, the Fed should have raised rates once the 2001 recession ended.

Neighbor_1: The 2016 election dragged the media’s credibility to an all-time low. By September, the media’s approval rating was a mere 19%—lower than the Democratic or Republican parties. Critics on the left have condemned the media’s extensive coverage of Donald Trump. Trump received at least $3 billion in free advertising from the media, almost three times what Clinton received. Republicans have criticized the overall liberal slant of most media outlets. Ninety-eight of the top 100 newspapers endorsed Hillary Clinton, and on election eve, all major outlets were predicting a Clinton victory. Huffington Post suggested that Clinton had a 98% chance of winning. In sum, the media’s performance this election cycle satisfied no one.
Neighbor_2: There is major, major trouble in the focus and direction of the Romney campaign in Boston. Remember, Mitt Romney's sole claim on the presidency was that he was the one person with the business experience to turn the economy around. The bet was that the slow economy would make the election a referendum on President Obama's economic stewardship. Well, the entire premise of his campaign has now come to bust , and they are now looking for a new argument The Romney campaign presented Mitt Romney's business experience as his main calling card for the presidency. But the Obama campaign took that head on, launching a late spring offensive that has pushed Mitt Romney's experience in business off the national discussion. He barely even brings it up on the stump these days as the Obama campaign turned his central strength into a stunning weakness. Now polls are reporting that voters rank President Obama and Mitt Romney even on the economy, while giving Obama large advantages on everything else.You can give Bill Clinton the credit for that. His masterful defense of the Obama economic program was a huge boon, as voters view President Clinton's economic credentials with trust and credibility. The Romney campaign also made the tremendous blunder of elevating President Clinton's credibility by praising him, leaving them no room to dispute anything Clinton said. A HUGE error in tactical political judgment and stunning for a modern presidential campaign.
Neighbor_3: ST. LOUIS — Senate Democratic leaders have long urged Hillary Clinton and her campaign to pay more attention to her party’s fight for control of the Senate, beyond mentioning local candidates at the beginning of her rallies. On Sunday, as Donald Trump reels and members of his party sprinted away from him, a top Clinton adviser signaled that such a shift may be coming.

Especially when he and Clinton were competing for the Democratic nomination, as evidenced by his famous “damn emails” line at CNN’s Democratic Presidential Debate last October. On Monday, the Vermont senator proved this yet again by defending Clinton against the ongoing Wikileaks email hack with a bit of self-deprecation.

Neighbor_2: At the end of the day, our list of 16 types is just as arbitrary as MeetingSift’s list of 6 types. What did we miss? What doesn’t work? Let us know. Comments are welcome. Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a "correct" one by excessive elaboration. On the contrary following William of Occam he should seek an economical description of natural phenomena. Just as the ability to devise simple but evocative models is the signature of the great scientist so overelaboration and overparameterization is often the mark of mediocrity. George Box in 1976 Journal of the American Statistical Association Or, stated more economically, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." We've tried to hit a mark that's useful in a way that simpler lists were not. We invite your feedback to tell us how we did. The 17th Type: BIG Meetings and Conferences Just when you think you’ve really broadened your horizons and been very thoroughly inclusive, you meet someone who sets you straight. I recently had the pleasure of meeting Maarten Vanneste, who is also a dedicated advocate for meeting design and the meeting design profession. It turns out that while we are using the same words, Maarten works in a very different world where a “meeting” might be a multi-day conference with dozens of sessions and a highly paid keynote speaker or 10. In that world, meeting planners handle logistics, room reservations, lighting requirements, branding, promotions… a wealth of detail that far exceeds anything we might worry about for even the most involved strategic planning workshop. This is so different, why even mention it? Because it’s another example of how using a generic word like “meeting” leads to bad assumptions. In case it isn’t clear, at Lucid when we talk about meetings and meeting design, we’re talking about the 16 types of day-to-day business meetings listed above. Professional meeting planning is a whole different kettle of fish.

They are all in the developer attention space but so are a lot of other things like World of Warcraft.

The US pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences had filed a patent application for its drug sofosbuvir, also known as “sofo,” which it sold under the brand name Sovaldi. The drug was approved for use by the United States government in December 2013, and had since revolutionised the treatment of hepatitis C, a viral disease that can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. According to estimates by the World Health Organisation, hepatitis C affects between 130 million and 150 million people across the world, and causes approximately 500,000 deaths each year. Sovaldi was far more effective against the disease than anything that had come before. It also did not cause the side effects that earlier drugs did, which were so brutal that patients often chose to forgo treatment altogether.

Neighbor_1: Actos is a Type 2 diabetes drug that lowers blood sugar by increasing the body’s sensitivity to insulin and reducing the amount of glucose the liver releases. This allows the body to better dispose of excess blood sugar. Its manufacturer, Takeda Pharmaceuticals America Inc., makes two additional versions of the drug that combine the active ingredient pioglitazone with metformin: Actoplus Met and Actoplus Met XR (extended release). The FDA approved Actos in 1999, Actoplus Met in 2005 and Actoplus Met XR in 2009. Eli Lilly partnered with Takeda to market the drug, and it became one of the most successful diabetes medications of all time. In 2007, it ranked as the world’s best-selling diabetes drug after studies linked rival drug Avandia to a higher risk of heart attack. Both come from the same family of drugs: thiazolidinediones, or TZDs. Before the medication’s patent expired in 2011, it had brought in $3.58 billion in United States sales in 2010. The drug’s sales made up 27 percent of Takeda’s revenue. However, numerous studies and a review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration linked higher dosages and prolonged use of the drug to an increased risk of bladder cancer. In its 2015 annual report, Takeda said it had set aside $2.7 billion to cover the costs of settling Actos lawsuits that blamed the drug for bladder cancer and other injuries. Despite the lawsuits and FDA review, doctors can still prescribe the drug in the United States. Meanwhile, health regulators in Germany and France ordered Takeda to pull the drug off the market in 2011 after an analysis of a company-sponsored study showed an increased risk of developing bladder cancer or heart problems.

Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523 000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined.Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent.Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (−6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), −10.6% to −1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant.
Neighbor_3: The study also found that the drug could reduce cases of and deaths from, lung cancer. No patients were known to have cancer when they entered the study. The highest dose appeared to cut lung cancer incidence by two-thirds, and deaths by three-quarters. But because heart disease was the main focus of the study, the authors called the cancer results "exploratory" and said more study is needed to see if they hold up. A drug that fights inflammation can reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and possibly lung cancer, in people who have already had one heart attack and are at high risk for another, a new study finds.Researchers outside the study say the findings represent a major milestone - proof of a biologic concept that opens the door to new ways of treating and preventing cardiovascular disease in people who are still at risk despite standard therapies."This is fantastic," said Dr. David J. Maron, the director of preventive cardiology at Stanford University School of Medicine. "The green light just went on for full-fledged investigation and development of effective and cost-effective new therapies."But experts also cautioned that potentially fatal side effects of the drug, as well as its high cost, mean it is unlikely to be widely used. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and in the United States, where it killed nearly 634,000 people in 2015. Globally, it killed 15 million.The drug that was studied, canakinumab, is already marketed under the brand name Ilaris, but was approved to treat a type of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and other rare disorders, not heart disease. It costs about $200,000 a year and is made by Novartis, which paid for the new study. The company declined to say whether the price would change if the drug came into more general use for heart disease.The drug works differently from the cholesterol-lowering statin medicines that have become mainstays in treating and preventing heart disease. Unlike statins, it has no effect on cholesterol. Instead, it reduces inflammation - the response by the immune system to injury or infection - which researchers have long suspected of playing a role in cardiovascular disease and cancer. About half of people who have heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels, and researchers think that in some of them, inflammation may contribute to heart and artery disease.But because the drug suppresses part of the immune system, it increases the risk of infections, including fatal ones. Deaths from infection in the study appeared to match lives saved by the drug, so there was no difference in overall mortality between the groups that got the drug and the placebo.An editorial by Dr. Robert A. Harrington of Stanford University in The New England Journal of Medicine, which published the cardiovascular results of the study on Sunday, described the cardiovascular benefit as "modest," called for more information about the fatal infections and said the drug was too expensive to be used in such a common disease.Dr. Eric Peterson, a cardiologist and the director of the Duke Clinical Research Institute at Duke University, also said he thought the drug would not be widely used, but added, "There might be ways to develop other drugs that could be safer and cheaper to lower inflammation."The Novartis drug is much stronger and works much faster, and by a different route, than more familiar anti-inflammatory medicines like aspirin and ibuprofen. It inhibits a substance called interleukin-1?, which causes systemic inflammation.Statins can also reduce inflammation, but not always as much as the newer drug. The new study included only people who had blood tests showing high levels of inflammation even though they were already taking statins and had lowered their "bad" LDL cholesterol to acceptable levels. The blood tests measured high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, and high was defined as two milligrams or more per liter of blood.There were 10,061 participants from 39 countries, with an average age of 61. A quarter was women, and 40 percent of all participants had diabetes.They were picked at random to receive either a placebo or an injection of the drug every three months, in addition to their usual statins and other heart medicines. Three different doses of the new drug were tested, and the patients were treated for a median of 3.7 years.The researchers found that in the placebo group, for every 100 patients followed for a year, 4.5 had a heart attack or stroke, or died from cardiovascular disease. In those who received the optimal dose of the drug, the rate was lower, 3.86. When the length of time patients were treated was taken into account, the reduction in risk was 15 percent."This is the first evidence we have that if you inhibit this inflammatory process without changing cholesterol at all, you're getting a risk reduction," said Dr. Paul M. Ridker, the first author of the study and director of the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.Dr. Daniel J. Rader, an expert in preventive cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not part of the study, said it offered "the first definitive clinical trial support for the concept that inflammation-targeted therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. I think that's extraordinarily important."If the drug is used in practice, Dr. Ridker said it should be limited to patients like the ones in the study, who have already suffered heart attacks and have high levels of inflammation and therefore high risk of heart attacks and strokes. Even within that group, he said he would limit its use further, to patients whose blood tests showed that the medicine significantly lowered inflammation. And they would have to be monitored carefully and treated quickly for signs of infection.The study also found that the drug could reduce cases of and deaths from, lung cancer.

Source: To avoid licensing infringements, the earliest incarnations of ZFS on Linux were written for the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE). This prevented the technology from touching the Linux kernel. It also added its fair share of limitations. Being in userspace, it never could really measure up to its Solaris and FreeBSD counterparts. Over time, some of the FUSE implementations were highly neglected and in some cases abandoned. In 2008, the "ZFS on Linux" project changed everything by developing an in-kernel implementation of ZFS. Since its conception, the project was met with a lot of resistance (and criticism) from within the Linux community, all relating to licensing.

Neighbor_1: Google urges the FASB to delve deeper on this core issue: “We encourage the FASB to consider issuing explicit guidance with respect to the accounting treatment of implementation costs, as these costs can be significant,” Thuener wrote. “We believe capitalizing the software implementation costs and amortizing the corresponding asset over its useful life better reflects the economics of the transaction as expenses are recorded in a manner that reflects the consumption of the economic benefit from the software implementation costs, and therefore is more helpful to readers of financial statements in the analysis of assets and expenses.”

Neighbor_3: This focus on a single language has had an interesting effect: It has encouraged me to improve my personal library of utility functions (teamten.jar above), since my efforts are no longer split across several languages. For example, I wrote a library that contains image processing routines. They’re both faster and higher quality than anything you can find in Java and Python. This took a while, but I know it’s worth it because I won’t find myself writing some Python script and wishing I could resize an image nicely. I can now confidently invest in Java as an important part of my professional and personal technical future.
Neighbor_4: We often hear from readers who want to track the development process of their favorite Linux distribution but don't know where to start. Budding Linux enthusiasts frequently ask how the release cycles work, what the version numbers mean, and what options are available for end-user testing prior to official releases. The answers to those questions differ depending on the distribution, but we are going to attempt to address those questions for Ubuntu, Fedora, and openSUSE—three of the most prominent desktop Linux distributions. We will also provide a brief visual comparison of upcoming versions with screenshots of the prereleases.

Then I said: ‘he must have been a resurrected Being.’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘and though Christ is said to have been the first fruits of them that slept, yet the Savior said he did nothing but what He had seen His Father do, for He had power to lay down his life and take it up again. Adam, though made of dust, was made, as President Young said, of the dust of another planet than this.’ I was very much instructed by the conversation and this days services.”
